[
The sun begins to rise over the mountains. Its light reaches the village and creeps toward
Marceline
.
]
Finn
: Marceline, no!
Marceline
: Don't let anyone read my diaries! Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi—! [
screams
]
[
Marceline is bathed in sunlight. The screen goes white, and a flashback begins. A young Marceline sits on her mother's lap in an RV.
]
Elise
: And then he said, "Fine." That's the story of how I met your
dad
.
Marceline
: Can I play now?
Elise
: No, Marceline, Sweetie. It's nap time.
Marceline
: But I don't want to sleep! My dreams are weird.
Elise
: All dreams are weird.
Marceline
: But, Mom, my dreams are we-e-e-eird.
Elise
: [
chuckles
] Honey, something weird might just be something familiar viewed from a different angle. And that's not scary, right?
[
She and Marceline embrace and sing "
Everything Stays
." The screen fades out, then returns to show Marceline a little older and packing a sled. Snow falls in a ruined city.
]
Simon
: [
voiceover
] Hello, Marci. I don't know if you'll ever hear this message. I fear my thoughts are no longer my own. Just watch over me...
[
Marceline looks over to see Simon recording himself.
]
Simon
: ...until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe,
Betty
, my princess—maybe you will love me again. [
sighs
] Please love me again, Betty! [
sobs
] Okay, bye! [
takes out tape and pushes over camera
] [
sighs
]
Marceline
: Hey, Simon. I, uh, finished packing your gear. So can I have my tape now?
Simon
: What? No. This is private, silly. [
tucks tape into bag on sled
] There you go. Snug as a bug.
Marceline
: Seriously, Simon. Please don't go.
Simon
: I... I have to protect you.
Marceline
: How can you protect me if you're not even here?!
Simon
: I'll arrange for someone to come take care of you. I'll make sure he doesn't leave.
Marceline
: Please, Simon, I could help you with this.
Simon
: Yeah, maybe one day you will. But until then, you have to stay brave, my fearless Marceline.
[
Simon touches her cheek as tears escape her eyes. His thumb touches the tear, freezing it. When he moves it, the frozen tear scratches her face.
]
Marceline
: Ouch!
Simon
: You see? I have to go now. Goodbye, Marci. [
hops on sled and leaves
]
Marceline
: What? No! [
chases after him
] Wait! Ugh! [
trips and falls in snow
] Simon! Simon!

Marceline
: Yah! Ew! [𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘭𝘢𝘶𝘨𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨] Okay, I know you're here.
The Fool
: Peek-a-pop! [Laughs]
Marceline
: The fool!
The Fool
: You found me, Marceline! Now you're it.
Marceline:
We're not playing, fool. You're an evil, blood-sucking fiend. I'm trying to kill you.
The Fool:
Hey, you want to see something funny? [Inhales deeply] I look like a butt. Pbht!
Marceline:
Ohh!
The Fool:
[Laughs]
Marceline:
[Coughing] Huh? [Sniffs]
The Fool:
[Laughing maniacally]
Marceline:
Oh. Cool. Sweet music to my ears.
Marceline:
Come on, little bun. Just turn around. Ugh, stupid animal.
Bunny Girl
:
Wha?!
Marceline:
Oh! I'm sorry! All right, hold still. There you go. See? It's okay.
Bunny Girl:
[Screaming]
Marceline:
No, kid! You don't have to be afraid of me! I'm a really good... person.
[Indistinct conversations]
Bunny Girl:
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!
All:
Huh?
Bunny Girl:
There's...Ohh, hoo... a vampire!
All:
No!
Bunny Girl:
Yes way. I saw it real close. It looked like a girl, but it had fangs like... [Grumbling]
Two Bread Tom:
Everybody, ready your weapons. Don't worry. We'll be ready for it.
[Bird squawking]
Marceline:
Ohh! [Gasps] Hey.
[All gasp]
Marceline:
No, no, i-it's cool. I'm on your side.
Two Bread Tom:
[Whimpers] Go away, vampire.
Marceline:
I'm in the sunlight. I'm not a flipping vampire!
[ All screaming ]
[ Sighs ]
Mm? Mm?
What's that?
Oh, you want old Two Bread Tom
to play the song.
Please do not
play the song.
No,
the child is right.
As humans, it's our duty
to tell the tales,
to sing the songs.
Art must survive.

[ Growls ]
[ Imitates guitar ]
You want me
to play more?
Two Bread Tom:
Yes, please.

your cover's better.

[ Bass playing ]
Hmm?
Oh, man, Schwabl,
I sure hope there ain't
a little vampire kid
sneaking up behind me.
Vampire attack!
Oh, no!
Ugh! I'm dead.
[ Spits ]
This is serious,
Marceline.
What if I was a vampire?
You need
an animal hat.
Looks like the project's
coming along, huh?
[ Foghorn blares ]
Waaaah!
[ Marceline whistles ]
Hey, Marceline!
Marceline!
Two Bread Tom,
how's it going, man?
Oh, so good.
I had a hoagie for lunch.
And even better, the ship's
repairs are almost done.
We should be ready to sail
in another day or two.
Oh, that's really great.
But listen,
I've cleared out
almost all the vampires
that are left.
In another week or two,
you won't even have to leave.
Yeah, Marceline!
Oh, Marci,
you're such a sweet weird kid.
But it's not just the vampires
or the oozers
or them hungry-looking rainbows.
The latest atmospheric readings
are going bananas.
Something big is coming.
And it's gonna change
all of this.
No, we'd do best to clear out
of this continent altogether.
Hey,
you should come, too.
After all,
you're one of us.
[ Bell clanking ]
They're here!
They're here!
Aah!
He's biting my hat!
Get to the boat!
[ Vampire grumbling ]
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, geez.
Oh, geez.
That's not Schwabl, man.
[ Laughs evilly ]
Well, you got me.
What gave it away?
The boots?
Aah!
Marceline!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hi, there, Hierophant!
Why can't you just let us
eat humans?
You're, like, messing up
the natural order.
This is our time.
It's MY time.
And once I stake and gank
your shape-shifting power,
I'll be unstoppable.
Ha!
[ Gasps ]
What?!
[ Laughs ]
I picked up self-healing power
last month,
of some vamp with a head
like a garden trowel.
So, you've slain
sister moon.
Look at you.
You're just
a hapa demon punk,
blind to the price you must pay
for such powers.
[ As Dracula ]
Blah! I don't care!
Fine.
Ah! Show yourself!
Okay.
Wah-wah.
[ Gulps ]
[ Laughs evilly ]
Ka-ching!
[ Gasps ]
Oh, geez.
Hey, Marceline,
let me "ax" you something.
[ Laughs ]
You get it?
You have to leave, Tom.
Oh, I didn't think
it was that bad.
You have to leave now!
Aah.
He's here.
He's the worst of them all --
the Vampire King.
[ Screaming ]
What?
Marceline, you're not dead!
Whoo!
P.B.'s cure.
It must have worked!
No soy vampire.
Also, untie me, please.
I'm not a murderer!
Okay, but wait,
if she's not a vampire,
then what's been draining
our cows?
[ Groans ]
Aah!
Finn?
Finn?
Geez.
I hope Finn
didn't get blood-sucked
after I stress-fainted.
Who the heck is this?
