[
In a forest, a group of vampires are playing instruments.
]
Fool
: Hey, this is nuts, right? [
floats over to
Vampire King
] Look, I've got both my teeth. [
points
] Look! I lost one in a box turtle once. Also, I used to be dead.
[
The Vampire King grabs him and sucks his tooth out of his mouth.
]
Vampire King
: Mwah! [
spits out tooth, which hits Fool in the eye
] Fool, this is
life
. Get a hot dog if you can't take the bun.
Empress
: Pah! It tastes different here. Where are we? It's like we fell asleep on a raft and woke up in strange seas.
Hierophant
: Hmph! "Fell asleep"? We died. The demon
Marceline
staked us all. Why are we back? How did it happen? Listen—I dunno and I don't care. We're alive and I'm going to get eating.
Empress
: Ugh.
Fool
: [
tries to put tooth back
] Ahhh... Does anyone have any milk for this? [
to
cow
] Do you, like, carry milk?
Cow
: Moo!
[
Vampire King places his hand on the cow's head.
]
Cow
: Moo?
Empress
: This is well and good for you, Hierophant, all you ever needed was a forest and something hot to chew on.
[
The Hierophant gnaws on his balalaika.
]
Empress
: Where are the comforts of the old hive? The minions... the blood... the
good
blood with the gold leaf flaked into it.
Vampire King
: The gold leaf was stupid. It didn't taste like anything.
Empress
: We had standards! It doesn't matter when we are or where we are, because... we are. We must start rebuilding our realm. There's life here, and I bet it's pathetic.
[
The Vampire King starts dancing with the cow and humming.
]
Empress
: We march in, we take control, and we rebuild the hive! My king, are you listening?
Fool
: I dunno. Like... [
yawns
] What if we just got a loft downtown?
[
The Empress shoots a beam from the gem on her forehead at The Fool.
]
Fool
: Whoops, I'm hypnotized. [
slaps himself
] Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
[
He falls on
The Moon
headfirst, his hat damaging her head. She shakes him off, and her head regenerates.
]
Fool
: [
laughs
] Good old backwards egg!
Cow
: Ugh. Ugh! I don't like to dance. I'm a wallflower.
[
Vampire King bites the cow.
]
Cow
: Oh! Ugh.
Hierophant
: My king, surely you agree that this is our chance to go back to our old ways. Surely diverging from the old ways is what made us vulnerable the first time. Surely—[
groans
]
[
Vampire King telepathically constricts The Hierophant and levitates him.
]
Vampire King
: "Surely"?! Surely? Shirley J. Temple! [
releases Hierophant
]
Hierophant
: Oh! [
lands with a thud
]
Vampire King
:
I
am your king, and
I
say it's a new era! Old-fashioned ideas have no place here.
[
The Hierophant transforms into a boar.
]
Hierophant
: [
growls
] Do what you like! I
know
what's right. [
runs off
]
Empress
: If you're going to caterwaul like this, then I may as well start building my army.
Hasta luego
, turds. [
walks off and disappears
]
[
The Moon backs away into the forest, leaving a trail of bubbles. The Vampire King is still dancing with the cow, and The Fool is playing a drum.
]
Cow
: Oh... gettin' dizzy...
[
A tiny
Jake
emerges from underneath a leaf, terrified and gasping for breath. He runs off.
]
Finn
: You sure the sun's not hurting you at all?
Marceline
: No, this is great. I can even feel my skin aging.
Jake
: Huff! Cow Teeth and Shirley temple Aaaaaaah! I ran into some vampires! They were being weird as crabs! Do you know these oily doilies, Marceline?
Marceline
: What?! No! I'm cured! It is weird though that it's happening at about the same time I got un-gunked. I gotta go see Bonnie. Ow! Oh yeah, guess I'm walkin'. No mo' powers.
Finn
: Didn't your daddy give you demon powers?
Marceline
: My Dad never gave me squat! Well, just some soul-sucking skills. Remember this?
Jake
: Aah! My soul! [
Marceline chuckles
] Ugh, even though I got my soul sucked, I'll still give you a ride to Bonnie's because I'm good.
Marceline
: Bonnie, I don't get it. Jake's talking about vamps at the same time you fixed me, and there can't be any still around!
Bubblegum
: Well, clearly something's creeping around.
Marceline
: Okay, what about the paste you took out of me? That should be all that is left that's vampiric in the modern world.
Bubblegum
: It's all over there, safely in the safety bucket. What?! Pep But, what'd you do with the gunk?!
Peppermint Butler
: Hold on, I'm working.
Jake
: Okay. There was one that looked like if a baby-snake was a baby-baby.
Jake
: Nah, that's not right. There was another one that looked like if an ant hill were a girl.
Jake
: Nah, that's not right. There's one of them that looked like a wet uncle.
Jake
: Nah, that's not right. There was a lady who looked like black drapes on a cake pop.
Jake
: Nah, that's not right. There was also one that looked like an angry stop sign coming out of a loaf of bread.
Jake
: Nah, that's not oh, actually that one's pretty close.
Marceline
: What?!
Vampire King
: You can stop this now, Marceline, it's not too late. You've got power now. I see it. But you haven't paid a price. It's making you crazy. Marceline, there's no one left but me. Would you wipe out an entire species?
Marceline
: For the last time, yes! That is literally my entire plan!
Vampire King
: So be it then.
Marceline
: Uh Duh.
Vampire King
: I gave you a chance, Marcel
Marceline
: Blah, blah, blah, blah!
Vampire King
: You know, Marceline, there's still another way.
Marceline
: Give it a rest already!
Vampire King
: No another 'nother way To save my people.
Marceline
: Wait! Noooo!
Marceline
: This is really bad. These guys They're heavy hitters. If they get back to full strength, they'll tear this world apart.
Bubblegum
: What's the plan, Marceline? How do we fight them?
Peppermint Butler
: [
Exaggeratedly clears throat
] If I may Strong enough for an ultravampire But made for a vampire.
All
: Wow.
Finn
: Look, Jake, a two-pronged stake And a stake boomerang.
Peppermint Butler
: Yes, and what's this behind your ear? A super garlic bomb!
Bubblegum
: What the heck, Peps? Why do you have all this vampire junk lying around?
Peppermint Butler
: I have these high-tech weapons painstakingly stockpiled in case a certain frenemy of yours decides to turn on us someday.
Bubblegum
: Peps!
Marceline
: No no, he's right. I could've snapped and done you all in at any time.
Jake
: Ugh!
Marceline
: The cave is totally empty. No sign of anyone.
Finn
: Phew!
Bubblegum
: Nothing going on out here either. Maybe we should all fan out Look for tracks.
Finn
: Or clues.
Marceline
: All right. But everyone be careful. Even in their mushy state, these guys'll crack up ya sacrum.
Jake
: Gross.
Bubblegum
: Don't worry about us, Marceline.
Finn
: Yeah, we're ready for anything.
Marceline
: Can't smell nuthin' no more. Ugh! Ahh. Crud.
Finn
: Whoops.
Peppermint Butler
: Oh no, my bomb!
Marceline
: Hey guys, why don't y'all head back to the cabin? I'm gonna try to put together a profile, you know Forensically.
Bubblegum
: Okay, Marceline, sounds good. Come on, boys, let's get you cleaned up.
Marceline
: I know you're in there, you skunk. You butt. You stain. You
Marceline
: Hey. Long time no see.
Vampire King
: Indeed.
Fool
: Hey! Marceline! Look at me! I'm all grown up now! I ate a chicken, Marceline.
Marceline
: I see you're getting your strength back.
Vampire King
: Yes, not long now.
Marceline
: Well don't get your hopes up.
Fool
: Pbht! Pbht!
Marceline
: Things are different now. The humans are long gone.
Vampire King
: Someone's smelling a bit human herself these days. Anyway, you don't need to worry, I've changed, as well. I only eat animals now. Just like everyone else.
Cow
: Ugh. Huh?
Vampire King
: Does that mean we can be friends now, Marceline?
Marceline
: It doesn't matter how you pretend to change. You've done enough already to get staked a thousand times over. You're monsters. You'll always be
Fool
: Smell my feet, Marceline. I promise you won't regret it. Oooh! Ohhhh Your loss.
Vampire King
: You know, the others won't be so easy, Marceline.
Marceline
: Well how 'bout you?
Vampire King
: It doesn't have to be like this.
Marceline
: Those are some pretty frou-frou last words.
Marceline
: You've lost a step! I'm not even gonna need my powers.
Vampire King
: I'm surprised, Marceline.
Marceline
: What now?
Vampire King
: Surprised you have the time to play around while the empress makes her way to the land of ice and snow.
Marceline
: Simon. Crud!
