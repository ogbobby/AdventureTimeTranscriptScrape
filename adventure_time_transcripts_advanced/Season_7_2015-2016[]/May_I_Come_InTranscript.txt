: No! [
slaps orb out of Finn's mouth
] Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or—
Marceline
: Whoa, chill, Jake. These pearls were dropped by The Moon. Her main power is accelerated healing. It'll be like fighting a cutting board.
Jake
: Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before—[
Finn pushes a pearl against Jake's cheek
] No! [

He and Finn tussle, shoving the pearl into each other's face.

Simon
is okay.
Jake
: Anyway... [

] I don't care how easy this vamp's supposed to be. We should hole up somewhere before the sun goes down—It's down. Great.

The gang follows Princess Bubblegum's lead. A nearby bush rustles and
Crunchy
emerges, out of breath. He gasps as
King of Ooo
, riding a horse and wielding a bow and arrow, jumps out of the bush after him and knocks him on his backside.

King of Ooo
: Ha-ha!
Crunchy
: Stop, please!
King of Ooo
: Don't be such a nerd, Crunchy. [

: [

King of Ooo
: Come on, Crunchy, it's dark. Let me tie you up.
King of Ooo
: Aha! Good growling, Crunchy.
King of Ooo
: All right, that's a bit much.
King of Ooo
: Whoa, girl! Oof! Ugh!
Crunchy
: Oh, no stop! Shush up! Huh? Oh!
Crunchy
: It's it's okay. Animals can't climb trees. That's what separates us from them.

: Ha! Dumb, lowly animals.

: No! No, no, no, no, no!
Hierophant
: Marceline Where is she?
King of Ooo
: Oh, boy! I-I wish I knew! No love lost there, am I right?

Crunchy
: Oh. Huh. Oh, this darn zipper Oh, brother.
Hierophant
: May I come in?
Gumbald's Cabin
: Aah! Ah ha ha! You're one of those old fashioned revenants, aren't you? You can't come in unless I invite you in! What do you think would even happen if you just walked in here, huh? You're so dumb, you sad old relic. How 'bout some garlic?
Hierophant
: Hmm.
