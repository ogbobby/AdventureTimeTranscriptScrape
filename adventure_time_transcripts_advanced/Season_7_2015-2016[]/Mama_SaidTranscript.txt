The episode begins with King of Ooo showing Finn and Jake a surveillance video (while they sit on tiny stools) of a flying mushroom shot in the Candy Kingdom
]
King Of Ooo
: [
Pointing to screen
] There. Right there. See?
Finn
: [
Squinting
] Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing?
Jake
: [
Moves uncomfortably
] Hey, do you have bigger chairs?
King Of Ooo
: [
Glares
] Stools.
Jake
: Huh?
King Of Ooo
: [
Walking toward Jake
] They're stools; not chairs.
Jake
: Well can I have a bigger stool, then?
King Of Ooo
: Jake, stop interrupting!
Jake
: Sorry.
King Of Ooo
: Enhance!
Banana Guards
: [
Push Finn and Jake while on the stools much closer to the TV
]
Finn and Jake
: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!
Jake
: Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms?
King Of Ooo
: Yes, very good, it is a mushroom! Or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools.
Finn and Jake
: [
simultaneously
] Oh.
King Of Ooo
: See, you guys gotta trust me on this one, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process! You can get up now.
Finn and Jake
: [
get up and crack their backs
]
Jake
: My legs.
King Of Ooo
: No, nobody's throwing mushrooms. [
moves closer to the TV
] I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in.
[
Finn, Jake, King Of Ooo, and two Banana Guards walk toward where the flying mushroom was shown
]
King Of Ooo
: Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction, [
points in direction flying mushroom came from
] so I want you two to head that way until you find one. A big one. and I want you to capture it, and bring it back.
Jake
: Why?
King Of Ooo
: Huh?
Jake
: Why?
King Of Ooo
: [
leans toward Finn and Jake
] Trust my process.
Jake
: Okay, but why, though?
Finn
: Yeah, we're curious.
King Of Ooo
: I wanna ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more. [
Dirt Beer Guy walks by in background
] Hey. Hey, you, what's your name?
Dirt Beer Guy
: I'm Dirt Beer Guy.
King Of Ooo
: What would you think if you saw me on a giant flying mushroom?
Dirt Beer Guy
: Boy, that'd really be somethin'.
King Of Ooo
: See? Don't fail on this one, boys. [
threateningly
] Don't you dare fail me.
Finn
: [
Walking through forest with Jake
] Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction.
Jake
: [
Stops walking, faces Finn
] Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes?
Finn
: [
Removing backpack
] Well we gotta find one first. [
Reaches in pack for something
]
Jake
: Yeah, that too. How long?
Finn
: [
Takes out water bottle, drains about a quarter of it, wipes mouth
] Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol.
Jake
: Tell who?
Finn
: KOO.
Jake
: ...King Of Ooo?
Finn
: Yeah.
Finn and Jake
: [
Laugh, continue to walk
]
Finn
: Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes?
Jake
: Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about?
Finn
: Hmm.
Jake
: [
Sniffs, stops, nose and mouth stretch out forward and sniffs for something, turns around
] I smell mushrooms.
Finn and Jake
: [
Run up a hill dotted with mushrooms
]
Finn
: Yeah, good job, Jake.
Jake
: Check it out. [
points to a relatively large mushroom
] Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny!
Finn
: Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying.
Jake
: Mmm, yeah... [
Finn and Jake look around for a bit
]
Finn
: I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly?
