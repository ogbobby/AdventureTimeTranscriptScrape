Viola
: Time... Is a slippery devil. Our lives are sudden. They come and go like... Like a summer shower.
Lumpy Space Princess
: Oh, my glob! You got the part!
Viola
: [ gasps ] I did?
Lumpy Space Princess
: Well, not that part. You were terrible. But you can be my personal assistant.
Viola
: Well... I guess I have to start somewhere.
Lumpy Space Princess
: Start with my laundry.
Tree Trunks
: Our lives are sudden. They come and go like a summer shower.
Lumpy Space Princess
: That was great! Well, maybe not "Great," But you were a lot better than those others.
[ cellphone vibrates ] [ door opens, bell jingles ]
Jake
: Hey!
Viola
: Hey!
Jake
: Hi, viola.
Viola
: Hi, dad.
Jake
: How's my big‐shot actress daughter? Did you get that part you wanted?
Viola
: Oh, yeah, the part... Sure, I got the part.
Jake
: Well, I think that's great. Just great. Seriously, that's so good to hear. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I haven't been the best dad. Maybe I blew it. But you getting that part, That makes my entire life seem worthwhile!
Viola
: Mmm.
Jake
: You're great, kid!
Viola
: Aww, you're great, dad! [ cellphone vibrates ] Dad, I have to go. I have a rehearsal.
Jake
: That's cool. Go get 'em, kid.
[ bell jingles ] [ sighs ]
Tree Trunks
: I do hope that Nigel had no trouble At chelmsyhead station. There are never any taxi cabs to be found...
Lumpy Space Princess
: What have I found here?! Is it a little mouse?
Lumpy Space Princess
: People, look what I found! It's a little mouse! Everyone else is really a square, Working together as a team, helping the author/director. Everyone has the team spirit! Everyone except the selfish little mouse!
Viola
: I'm sorry, I was ‐‐
Lumpy Space Princess
: Don't interrupt me when I'm berating you!
Mr. Cupcake
: [ clears throat ] When are we going to resume rehearsing?
Lumpy Space Princess
: Don't interrupt me when I'm berating my assistant For interrupting me... Unless you want some, too!
Mr. Cupcake
: Well, no.
Lumpy Space Princess
: I can't remember what I was saying. Assistant, read me back my notes.
Viola
: Hmm. You were wrapping it up so we could get back to rehearsal.
Lumpy Space Princess
: Okay...Let's rehearse!
Crunchy
:  Mr. Cramforth will be drenched If he walks to the cottage from the station.
Tree Trunks
: Poor suffering Nigel! Um...
Lumpy Space Princess
: "But he"...
Tree Trunks
: But he is　so awfully amusing.
[ rumbling ]
Mr. Cupcake
: Coming down like cats and dogs. Reminds me of the rain we had ‐‐
Lumpy Space Princess
: Too much water on the coat! It's not a hurricane! Again!
[ rumbling ]
Coming down like cats and ‐‐
Lumpy Space Princess
: That's too light! It's not a drizzle! Hey, viola! [ whistles ] Viola![ whistles ] Here, girl![ whistling ] Come on, I want to show you something.
Lumpy Space Princess
: I think it's gonna rain soon, So I'm gonna show you What real summer showers look like. And I want you to make little sketches of raindrops As reference material.
Viola
: Do you really think this is worthwhile?
Lumpy Space Princess
: Yes! Gah! How can I explain this as simply as possible? In my play, I don't want to see big, big gloopy raindrops. And I don't want to see teeny‐weeny, tiny raindrops. What I want to see is raindrops that are just right.
Viola
: Neither too big nor too ‐‐
Lumpy Space Princess
: Stop interrupting me when I'm trying To explain things childishly! Every element of "Summer showers" Has to have class. You know, I may be a princess, But when people meet me, they don't think "Princess." They think"Lumpy space princess." I bet if I was"Princess bubblegum buns" Or "Sugarplum buns princess" Or something, Things would be way different. They have absolutely no imagination! I'm the one who has imagination! I'm the one who's special! I think my play will prove that... [ sighs ] I've had a really crummy life. Everything was okay when I was a little kid. And I could just hang out by myself and make up little games.
Viola
: Have you tried talking about this with anyone else?
Lumpy Space Princess
: No! It's part of your job! You're lucky, it's starting to rain. Now, pay close attention to these raindrops. You should fill the whole sketchbook! I want to see some classy raindrops on opening night! [ lock engages ]
Tree Trunks
: It's so good to see you, Nigel. Let Chelmsford take your overcoat.
Mr. Cupcake
: Very well, tree trunks.
Lumpy Space Princess
: Her name is Miranda Hobson!
Mr. Cupcake
: I don't know if I can call tree trunks by that other name. It seems dishonest.
Lumpy Space Princess
: [ groans ]
Lumpy Space Princess
: This play is set in a country called eng‐land. And in eng‐land, anyone called tree trunks Is always called"Miranda Hobson" During the summer.
Mr. Cupcake
: I didn't know that.
Lumpy Space Princess
: Yeah. So let's ‐‐ whoa! How did you get here? I locked the d‐‐never mind. Have you finally figured out what rain looks like? [Viola nods] Let's take it from the top!
Mr. Cupcake
: Coming down like cats and dogs. Reminds me of the rain we had when mother was still alive.
Lumpy Space Princess
: It'll have to do.
Lumpy Space Princess
: Still lots to finish! Stay sharp! Keep it classy! Let's take it from act two!
[ rumbling ]
Mr. Cupcake
: How lovely you looked this afternoon, tree trunks ‐‐
Lumpy Space Princess
: Miranda!
Mr. Cupcake
: Miranda Hobson.
Tree Trunks
: Oh, Nigel! You've always made me smile.
Viola
: Even when we met,
Tree Trunks
: As children at the badminton tournament.
Viola
: You were such a mischievous little boy ‐‐
Tree Trunks
: And you still are. Mwah!
Mr. Cupcake
: [ yawns ] I admit I feel quite sleepy!
Viola
: The summer showers always did affect you that way.
Tree Trunks
: I'll let him rest. After all, the rain can't last forever.
Lumpy Space Princess
: That wasn't too bad, actually.
[ telephone rings ]
Tree Trunks
: Yes, hello. Miranda Hobson speaking.
Citizen Peanut
: Yes, Ms. Hobson, you won't remember me, but my name is Wilfrid. We met in April at the Chestnut Festival at St. Margaret's School. I'm between trains and I thought I might drop by.
Tree Trunks
: No visitors to Bulkley cottage all season,
Viola
: And now two in one day!
Lumpy Space Princess
: The doors open in an hour. Here's a pep talk. Tonight is your night to be special, 'cause you're in a pretty darn special play ‐‐ Written by me. Directed by a pretty special director ‐‐ also me. Hey, viola!
Viola
: Yes, director LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess
: Where's our leading lady? Oh, there you are! What's the matter? You look like you're going to throw up.
Tree Trunks
: I'm going to have to back out of the play.
Lumpy Space Princess
: What?!
Tree Trunks
: When I told Mr. Pigabout the kissing scene, He didn't take it well.
Mr. Pig
: Kissing scene?! K‐kissing scene?! Kissing scene!
Tree Trunks
: I'm dreadfully sorry.
Lumpy Space Princess
: You can't do this to me! Who else knows all the lines?! Who else could possibly take your place at the 11th hour And be a big hero!? [ Viola gasps ] Viola! Your excited gasp just gave me an idea! I'll play the part!
Lumpy Space Princess
: She sells seashells by the seashore. She sells seashells by the seashore.
Viola
: I'm sorry!
Ice King
:  Are you really here, or are you, like, an eye floater?
Lumpy Space Princess
: I've been usurped!
Viola
: I can't believe this is our last summer here.
Mr. Cupcake
: But everything changes, I suppose. Oh, one thing hasn't changed ‐‐ You've never looked lovelier... Miranda Hobson.
[ LSP growling ]
[ rumbling ]
Viola
: I'll let him rest. After all, the rain can't last forever.
[ LSP growling ]
Viola
: How long have we been sitting here on the couch, Wilfrid?
Citizen Peanut
: Ages and ages. But not nearly long enough!
[ LSP roaring ]
Viola
: One looks for a little brightness to warm the days. I thought that Nigel Cramforth had that brightness. But now I see that doesn't matter. For you have a different kind of brightness ‐‐ A kindness that will always make the cold ham And bitter rain of eng‐land seem like hot tea, And sweet strawberry jam, and summer showers.
[ light applause ]
Jake
: Whoo! Viola! That's my girl!
[ louder applause ] [ cheering ] [ murmuring ]
Jake
: You were great, kid!
Viola
: Thanks, but it's not as if I wrote the play. That was ‐‐
[ door slams ]
Lumpy Space Princess
: I should be mad... But you were so amazing!
Jake
: She's quite the actress.
Lumpy Space Princess
: What?! No, the acting was fine... But the rain! It looked so real on the overcoats! How did you do it? This play is gonna run for 20 years! [ laughing ]
[ Jake and Viola chuckle ]
Viola
: That was my job, actually ‐‐ Putting raindrops on the overcoats. I only went on stage as a last‐minute replacement.
Jake
: You mean you did the special effects! You're amazing, kid!
Viola
: Aww... You're amazing, dad!
Jake & Viola
: You're amazing!
