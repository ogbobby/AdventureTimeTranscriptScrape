Mmm...
He is real!We video chat sometimes.
We need to find him beforethey give the oath of office
To vice president blowfish.
Bmo: that creep!
Okay, let's go findpresident porpoise.
I guess we should askbanana man
If we can borrowhis submarine.
Banana man: no problemo![ both scream ]
Anything to help the friendof my friend.
Uh... What are ya doingbehind our couch, neighbor?
Sometimes I get lonely
And need to hear the soundof other people talking.
We should let it slideso we can use his sub.
But only if I can gowith you guys.
Nobody steers thes. S. Inquisitive but me!
Then it's the three of us!
Four!
[ all laugh ]
Ice king: five![ all scream ]
[ chuckles ]
Uh... Anybody else?
Okay, let's go!
As soon as I finish loadingthese supplies, we can ship out.
Finn,you're my first mate.
Nice.
Jake,you're my morale officer.
You keep our spirits upwhile the sub is down.
What's my job, finn?
You have the most importantjob of all, bmo ‐‐
To distract ice kinguntil we get away.
That decision was goodfor morale!
[ both laugh ]
Aah!
Hey! You forgot meand the cabin boy here!
Hey!
Shh!We are on the submarine.
What?!No, we're not!
Yes, see?
Chk, chk, whir.
Beep, beep, beep...
Think we'll seeany beautiful mermaids?
Get serious, lieutenant!We're in dangerous waters!
Aye‐aye, sir!
I'm locking inthe coordinates
For the last‐known whereaboutsof president porpoise.
Aye‐aye, sir!
Hey, jake, do you thinki'm doing a good job,
Like, as a first mateor whatever?
Yeah, man,you're doing great...
Consideringwe're all gonna die.
Wait, what?We're all gonna die.
You're supposed to be keepin'our spirits up, remember?
Yeah, but it's so crampedin here.
Ooh! B. R. B.!
Jake?
Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I just had to shrink downa little!What?
Look at all this roomi have!
Ha, cha cha cha ‐‐whoa! [ screams ]
Jake?!
[ screams ]
I'm good!
What?Banana man: hey, finn,
Can you come help me
Calibrate the windshieldwiper fluid valve?
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
[ screams ]
I'm good!
[ laughs ] what?
Look at how small I am.
[ laughs ]
When did you getso claustrophobic?
It's a middle‐age thing,I think.
Okay, I guess I can calibrate itby myself.
[ chuckles ]me, too, huh, guys?
[ murmuring ]
Will my colleague fromthe great kelp forest yield?
Thank you.
The president is missing.Yes, we all agree.
Vice president blowfishis acting president.
Again, yes, agree.
But to swear in a new president
While the current oneis missing?
Do not agree!
This is an outrage,secretary octopus!
Undersea law dictates thatwhen the clock strikes 5:00,
I become president!
You're not allowed to puff outin the court of food!
[ rumbling ]
Attention, fish parliament!We're here to help!
Who and what are you?
Jake, get up here!
Stuck again!
My brother video chats sometimeswith the president.
I'm a good friendof president porpoise!
[ murmuring ]
[ sighs ]
Hi.
Oh!
Aw.
Boy, when I first signed upfor this adventure,
I just wanted tosee pretty mermaids.
But now I realizeit's all about the camaraderie
I do know.I had a feeling you'd ‐‐
Hmm.I don't like the look of this.
Everything okay, sir?
No.We are running out of air.
[ gasps ]we need to surfaceimmediately.
But if we show ourselvesnow,
The enemywill be right on top of us!
Shh!
[ murmuring ]
Finn: please,just give us a chance!
Just make me president!
Don't trustthese filthy surface boys!
I guess it is kind of weirdthat you guys just showed up
And you're not even fish.
We're mammals,just like president porpoise!
Yeah, man!Nerves and fur.
Oh, that's a good point!
Uh, wait!
I demandthis be put to a vote!
Wow, this is intense!
Okay, everyone who thinksthese guys should just go away,
Raise your fins or clawsor whatever.
Two, four, five...
And with governor anglerfish,that's seven.
Oh, eight!Wow. All right, eight.
And everyonewho wants them to stay
And help find the president?
No one?
Oh, wait.Representative sybil.
[ gasps ]
Well, if that's everyone,then the final vote is ‐‐
Wait!I haven't voted yet.
Ahh!
Ha! There!Now it's nine to eight!
The yeas have it.
Finn and jake,you have...
20 minutesto find the president!
They must givea 20‐minute presentation first!
We're on to you,blowfish!
[ panting ]
Stay collected,lieutenant!
We'll get you home to thechildren you speak of so fondly!
It's no good.My guns are barkin'.
[ gasps ]
[ grunts ]
Pull yourself together,lieutenant!
Slap, slap!I bring my boys home!
[ grunting ]
Careful,I bruise easily.
Finn: you're acting highly sus,v. P. Blowfish!
I suspectyou may have had a hand
In prez porp's disappearance![ all gasp ]
V. P. Blowfish: you be quiet!You're not right!
Okay, guys!I'm going to go look for clues!
Something about this wholesituation smells fishy!
Ah! Ha ha!
Whoa!
[ murmuring ]
President porpoise!
President porpoise?
President...
It's like there'sthis instruction manual
That explainshow to talk to people
And everyone in the worldgot a copy except me.
Oh! [ chuckles ]just, uh, taking a break.
Gonna keep looking!
Uh, what?

But I should probably go help myfriends find president porpoise.
Eh, come on,who cares?
Oh!
But he's your president.
National politics don't reallyrepresent my interests.
[ chuckles ] okay.
Talk, blowfish!Where's the president?
I don't know where he is!I'm the president now!
[ clock chimes ][ laughs evilly ]
Oh, no, bro!
[ screams ]do not agree!
[ chirps ]
Huh?!
President porpoise!But where have you...
A three‐day weekend?
I don't rememberyou mentioning that.
I tied a string to my tentacleto remind myself?
Nope, nope, nope, nope,nope, nope, nope...
N‐‐ oh!Well, I'll be!
Isn't it always on the last armyou check? [ chuckles ]
Please, finn and jake,when you return to dry land,
Tell no oneof our lax record‐keeping.
Ah, don't worry,secretary octopus.
We wouldn't want todeflate anyone's ego!
[ both laugh ]
Huh?!
Ahh! Oh![ clears throat ]
My kidsmust be worried sick!
[ high‐pitched squeaking ]
Man, I can't understanda word you're saying.
I said,where's banana man?
We're getting low on air,and I'm freaking out.
Uh, maybe there's a radioor something.
Huh?Oh! Oh!
Aagh!
[ laughter ]
You know what, bro?I'm glad you're here.
'cause dying together sucksa little less than dying alone.
