[
At the
Tree Fort
, "Moe" is reading the newspaper to
Finn
and
Jake
.
]
Moe
: Let's see, $4 off a... honey-baked ham. I don't like ham. $1 off of beets. Do beets have tannins? What is that? Oh! $4 off a honey-baked ham.
Jake
: Moe?
Moe
: Call me "Gwampa." How's your rose water?
Jake
: It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, Gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with
Neptr
. He can rap or something.
[
Neptr rolls in and spins around.
]
Neptr
: [
rapping
] B-b-b-bread, where's my needle and thread?
Moe
: No!
Finn & Jake
: [
gasp
]
Moe
: Eh, well, Neptr is too distracting. Who wants to play video games?
Jake
: Oh, you have games like
BMO
? Let's do that, Gwampa!
Moe
: I have
one
video game. It's called "Hangman."
Jake
: [
gasps
]
Finn
: That sounds griz as nuts!
Jake
: Yeah, let's play hang-a-man!
Moe
: Coming right up! [
ejects controller and boots up game
] Pick a letter.
Jake
: Show us what you did, hangman!
Moe
: [
buzz
] Pick a letter.
[
Back at
MO Co.
, BMO is trying to figure out how it can help itself and
ALLMO
escape.
]
BMO
: But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still -- even though it's my birthday -- Happy Birthday, BMO.
ALLMO
: I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here.
BMO
: I will do what I can.
ALLMO
: All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side. [
Cut to a diagram showing a path leading from one side to the other, then cut back to BMO and ALLMO.
] But it's too high up.
BMO
: Oh. [
It thinks up a plan.
] What if we use this trash [
It picks up a couple of pieces.
] to climb up to the vent?
ALLMO
: But all this trash is too small.
BMO
: [
putting the two pieces together
] Ah-huh!
ALLMO
: Whoa. You just blew my mind.
[
Back at the Tree Fort, Finn and Jake are bored playing "Hangman" with "Moe".
]
Jake
: What haven't we guessed yet? "B."
[
The word is completed as "Burgess Meredith".
]
Jake
: "Burgess Meredithe"?! [
"Moe"'s screen changes to a guy swinging a wrecking ball, with "win" on the bottom of the screen.
] I don't even know what that is!
MO
: Do you boys want to play again?
Finn
: [
groans
]
MO
: Boys love games. [
reboots up game
] Pick a letter.
Jake
: Uh, I don't know, "E.' [
Three "E's" pop up on the blank spaces.
] Is this "Burgess Meredithe" again?! [
A "B" pops up on the first blank letter space.
] Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman.
[
Finn and Jake leave, with Neptr smiling at "Moe", whose smile changes to a blank expression.
]
[
At MO Co., BMO has made a ladder out of various trash objects leading to the vent. It crawls through then stops when it sees a stuffed doll with its head ripped off. It opens a grate at the edge, leading to a strange bedroom.
]
BMO
: Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up.
ALLMO
: It is the room of
AMO
, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love -- that those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer.
BMO
: [
entering back into the garbage room
] Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO.
ALLMO
: But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know.
BMO
: But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body.
ALLMO
: Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a cannon phaser on top of its head?
BMO
: No. [
laughs
]
ALLMO
: Phew!
BMO
: [
laughs
] He had a huge, gigantic wig on. [
It realizes something.
] Uh-oh.
ALLMO
: What?
BMO
: The spikes are under the wig!
ALLMO
: Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway.
BMO
: Uh...
ALLMO
: You're stronger than you know.
BMO
: [
puts its hand on its screen
]
ALLMO
: Also, I'm lighter than you know.
[
Cut to outside the Tree Fort, where Finn and Jake are looking for some real hangmen.
]
Finn
: I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen.
Jake
: I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one.
MO (OS)
: Bloo-hoo. Bloo-hoo.
[
Finn and Jake run over to find "Moe" crying and lying on the snow face first.
]
MO
: Ah, bloo-hoo.
Finn
: Moe! [
He picks "Moe" up.
]
MO
: Bandits stole my legs!
Finn
: [
noticing that "Moe"'s legs are missing
] Yeesh.
Jake
: If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs!
Finn
: We're sorry we left you!
MO
: You should be. I'm your Gwampa wobot. Carry me. [
Finn does so.
] Over here. [
They walk over to a cave where Neptr is laying.
] There! There's the thief! [
He points to Neptr, with "Moe"'s legs inside him.
] The thief with my legs!
Finn
: Neptr?
MO
: Throw him out! [
sobbing
]
Finn
: Come on. Maybe Neptr did it like, accidentally?
Jake
: [
feeling Neptr's head
] Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head.
Finn
: What? Who could have done that?
MO
: Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO?
Finn
: What? You're all right, but we -- we love BMO.
Jake
: Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend.
MO
: BMO's trash!
Finn
: Moe!
MO
: [
He changes his face, grows new legs, takes off his wig, revealing jagged prongs and a laser cannon on his head, and changes his voice.
]
Moe
's dead! [
He removes a sticker on the left of the "MO" on his body, revealing his true name: AMO.
]
Finn
: "Ah-mo"?
AMO
: You don't love me! [
shoots a cannonball on Jake's head, then another on Finn's
]
Jake
: Ow!
Finn
: Aah!
AMO
: Wake up and love me!
BMO (OS)
: Imposter!
[
AMO turns around and sees BMO carrying ALLMO.
]
BMO
: AMO!
AMO
: Hello, BMO. I'm your cute sibling, AMO.
BMO
: I know about you and your dirty hands. Where are Finn and Jake?
AMO
: I think Finn and Jake went somewhere to buy me a gift.
BMO
: Tell me what you did with Finn and Jake and our poop.
AMO
: Ay!
BMO
: [
growls
]
AMO
: AYYYYY!
BMO
: AMO, look at my face! You gone too far!
AMO
: Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Bye! [
runs away
]
BMO
: [
chasing after AMO
] You can't escape the birthday boy!
AMO
: [
Reaching the edge of a cliff, he struggles not to fall.
] Too high.
BMO
: Hey! Talk, AMO!
AMO
: You want to know where Papa is? Here is all that remains of him -- [
picks up his laser cannon
] his memory backup drive.
BMO
: Oh.
[
Flashback to AMO walking alone in the desert.
]
AMO (VO)
: I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront Papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying. [
Cut to a dying Moe talking to AMO.
] "AMO, dear child, my body is conking out. [
coughs
] Take this. [
Moe takes off his wig, revealing his memory backup drive, and gives it to AMO.
] It is who I am. Send my mind into space so I may spend the eons among the stars and other brilliant gases." [
Moe dies, then AMO touches his hand.
] His hands were as cold as clay. Our Papa never loved me, so I ignored his last request. [
He looks at a memory of Moe creating DMO.
] I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them.
DMO
: Is that you, AMO?
AMO (VO)
: They didn't love me, either.
DMO
: Where you been? [
chuckles
] What are you doing? [
AMO rips off part of its body.
] No!
AMO (VO)
: Then I learned about you and your new family. [
He looks at a memory of Moe and BMO talking to Finn and Jake.
] I wanted a taste of that melon. [
He leaves the factory to go to Finn, Jake, and BMO.
]
[
End of flashback.
]
AMO
: People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all!
BMO
: You cheat. Give me those memories. [
AMO blasts a cannonball at BMO, breaking its screen knocking it out alongside a rock. It gets back up.
]
AMO
: BMO, I don't want to look at you! [
He blasts another cannonball at BMO, ripping its right arm.
]
BMO
: Tough nuts! For Moe!
[
AMO blasts some more cannonballs at BMO; it misses them and grabs the last one, sending AMO falling down the cliff. An explosion is heard. BMO looks down and sees a hole with smoke coming out through it. AMO's heart shuts off.
]
ALLMO
: BMO! [
BMO turns around and sees ALLMO being pushed.
]
Finn
: Hey. [
He, Jake, and Neptr come out from behind ALLMO.
] We caught the tail end of what happened. Are you okay?
BMO
: No.
Jake
: Well, I don't like that.
ALLMO
: BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader.
BMO
: I don't think I can. I'm not grown up -- or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice.
Finn
: All right.
Jake
: Sorry your birthday was weird.
[
Finn and Jake push ALLMO back.
]
BMO
: That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown.
[
In BMO's imagination, various colored BMOs appear surrounding it.
]
Red BMO
: Except that the mission was just some made-up lie.
Orange BMO
: So who knows if I will ever grow up at all.
Yellow BMO
: And Moe is gone now. [
Flashback to Moe hugging BMO.
] So if there is anything he wanted to teach me, it better be in me already. [
Flashback ends.
]
Green BMO
: I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me.
Blue BMO
: Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad.
Purple BMO
: So what if I turn out bad, too?
ALLMO (flashback)
: AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be.
BMO
: But I am different. It's not just Moe up here, [
points to its head
] it's me, too.
All BMOs
: And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me.
[
The colored BMOs fuse back into BMO.
]
BMO
: Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown. [
It looks at Moe's memory drive.
] I miss you, Moe. What a day! [
smacks lips; yawns; it turns on Moe's memory drive, opening a memory of a younger Moe talking to BMO
]
Moe
: I'm gonna miss you, too, BMO. I feel so very, very proud of you. [
He kisses it on the screen.
]
BMO (flashback)
: [
smacks lips; yawns
]
