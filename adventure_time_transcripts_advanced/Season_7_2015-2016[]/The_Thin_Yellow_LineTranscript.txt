I'm tired of"Pilgrims of the land."
I hate that board game.
You're just saying that because Pep but beat you every time.
It's just pilgriming around. There's no point.
There point is building and developing holdings
While trading and acquiring resources.
Yeah, well, nobody ate my guac.
This is homemade, broham.
This ain't no store guac.
You know I love your guac.
Hmm.
[ smooches ] magnifique.
No, this is bad.
Maybe you don't get art.
It's disrespectful to the kingdom's holdings.
[ gasps ]it's fresh.
[ paintbrush scratching ]
[ gasps ]
[ gasps ]
That's illegal!
And beautiful.
[ panting ]
What?
Yah!
Aw.
‐oh, hi.‐hey.
‐hey, stop.‐no. Wait.
Eh.
[ indistinct conversations ]
Stop!
Hey!
Huh?
Hi.
Hello.
You already grabbed me.
You sure?
Hmm.
This...This is...
‐delinquent vandalism?‐a beautiful statement?
...Very interesting.
Go back to the barracks
And find out which Banana Guard is responsible for this.
Why don't you just go and ask them yourself?
The Banana Guards are really afraid of getting into trouble.
They love me, but I think they're secretly scared of me.
Here. You can slip in during the changing of the guards.
[ bush rustling ]
Not yet.
[ watch ticks ]
Three, two, one.
[ door clanks ]
[ all grunting ]
10 whipped cream pies.
Oh!
[ clatter ]
[ bugle playing ]
That's enough, Banana Guard 12.
Okay, everyone, time for morning calisthenics.
Jump for old colonel.
[ chuckles ] yes. Good.
[ Banana Guards grunting ]whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
All right, now, that's enough.
It's time for daily worship.
Gaze upon the divine and terrible countenance.
[ Banana Guards "Ooh" ]
Please, almighty princess, forgive us.
[ all speak indistinctly ]
Sorry, Pb.
Yeah, man. Me, too, prubs.
Come on, bro. Just 10 more reppies.
[ sighs ]
How the hank are we gonna find out
Which one of them is the graffiti fiend?
[ grunts ]that's easy, man.
We'll lure him out of hiding with an irresistible temptation,
Then trap him.
Watch and learn, rookie.
[ slurps ]good sesh, bro.
Yeah, brothers!
We're all brothers, you know,
Fighting crimes and making rhymes, right?
[ laughs ]
But also how about making a little crime ourselves, right?
I mean, how do we know about crime if we never done one before?
‐am I right?‐that makes sense.
Why don't we meet over by that big, blank wall later tonight
Bring a little paint, and see where things go from there, eh?
[ chuckles ]
I don't see anybody, Jake.
They'll be here.Don't worry none.
My plan is good.
Both: aah! What the...?
There they are![ crying ]
Those guys wanted to commit crimes!
No, we ‐‐[ whap! ]
[ both grunt ]
[ sighs ]
We caught the crime‐inals!
Oh, I just got that.
Good job, boys.
Just leave them to me.
What the heck, Finn?
I was just trying to shake the bushes, you know?
Lure them out of hiding with an irresistible ‐‐
Oh, hold up. I already did this bit.
Well, you got to be more subtle next time.
What next time? They know our faces now.
Banana Guards, please welcome these new recruits.
‐hello.‐hello.
Okay, subtle.
Maybe we should split up and just look around ‐‐
Cover more ground that way.
Now, that's some detective thinking, finn.

[ neigh ]
What the...? Horse?
Hey,man is there a horse in ‐‐
Hmm?
‐hey, what was that?‐nothing.
Swore I heard a ‐‐
[ neigh ]wha?
[ drawer clanks ]files.
What?
All files.
Please go away.
Mm. Okay.
[ neigh ]
I want back in there now!Come on!
I love you.
Eugh.
[ feet screech ]hey, did you see a‐a ‐‐
A something come by here?
No. Just me and this door here.
Ooh, yeah. Showers.
Sweet, hot shower to get my head back on straight.
[ Banana Guard vocalizing ]
Oh, that heavenly singing.
Hey, who's singing in there?!
[ singing stops ]
I like your... Song.
[ valve squeaks ]
[ zoom! ]
[ door clanks ]
‐now, hold on a second.‐I love you.
Get out of here right now, you.
[ neigh ]
[ groans ] some kind of conspiracy is afoot,
But how deep does this rabbit hole goooo?
[ indistinct conversations ]
[ chuckles ]
Hey, man, that's not bad.
It's not that great.
No, it's good, man.
Maybe, though, add some shading
Around where the headshadows the neck.
Make sure it's obvious wherethe light source is coming from.
It'll help give the drawing more volume and depth.
Whoa. You're really good at art, man.
[ thinking ] art.
Could this be the guy?
Gotcha.
Well, bye.
Oh, oh, uh, uh, wait a minute.
Mister...?
Banana Guard 16.
You sure know a lot about art and stuff.
Yeah.
Do you have some art of your own I could look off of
And get, um, I don't know, inspiration from?
Inspiration.
Follow me.
♪
[ vent clanks ]
In here.
I found this walled off area while cleaning one day.
I like to use it as my, uh, my studio, I guess.
Maybe this will inspire you.
[ gasps ]
Oh, my glob. These are gorgeous.
Hey, thanks.
Is this why you've been painting outside walls, Banana Guard 16?
Uh...I just needed more space to expressmy artistic impulses.
[ neigh ]
This stuff is great.
You should hang it in a gallery.
No. Princess Bubblegum would hate that.
Banana Guards are just supposed to...guard.
She's take me apart to find out what went wrong.
Nah. She's nice, dude.
Nice? Don't you know nothing?
She's an unknowable goddess.[ thunder crashes ]
When the first candy people rose against her,
She transformed them into hideous monsters.
Her own brother, Neddy, she imprisoned him beneath the great tree.
And the rattleball boys?
She iced all those guys.
She's amazing, and she's flipping scary.
But nice.
I never show anybody this place.
If they found me out, who knows what dark and terrible fate would await me.
But I don't know, man.
I trust you.
We're kindred artistic souls.
Totes.
Ha‐ha! Busted!
Slam!
Jake!
Got him in his hidey‐hole.
Good work, Finn.
You set me up.
[ thinking ]man, banana guarding is rough.
Hmm. One rando genetic mutation,
And any one of those dudes would be in the same boat as bg‐16.
[ gasps ] the same boat.
Oops!
Oh, sorry, man. There you go.
Hey, wait.That's not the same ‐‐
[ bugle plays ]
Banana Guard 16, step forward.
Sorry, Pb.
I goofed up. I think we lost him.
I'm Banana Guard 16.
Aw, dude. Come on.
Punish me.
I am ready.
No! I am Banana Guard 16.
I am Banana Guard 16.
‐I'm Banana Guard 16.‐I'm Banana Guard 16.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm Banana Guard 16.
[ all gasp ]
I'm not gonna punish you, Banana Guard 16.
You're not?
Of course not.
Your murals are so beautiful.
I want you to paint one in the banquet hall.
The princess spared him.
She's so merciful.
Make way!
Oh, merciful princess.
Uh...
Thank you for sparing your lowly servant.
[ Banana Guards speaking indistinctly ]
Buh‐buh‐buh. No, no, no.
I'm just a person.
I've done things in the past, things I'm not proud of.
But today, I'm here to celebrate.
Oh!
Princess...
Mm‐hmm?
...I love you.
Wow.
[ neigh ]
[ applause ]
My Banana Guards are so talented.
I grew these hi‐da‐roponically.
And I can actually play really good.
[ bugle plays ]
[ vocalizing ]
Um, princess?
Yes?
I don't have a special talent.
That's okay, too.
Hooray!
