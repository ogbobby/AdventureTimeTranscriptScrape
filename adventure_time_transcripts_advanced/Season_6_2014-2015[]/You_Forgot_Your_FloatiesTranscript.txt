Finn
:
Glob
's helmet coming in fast!
Jake
: Yo, I'm zoomed in too far. Making me sick.
[
They both shout
]
Finn
: See it?
Jake
: [
Burps
] Sees it!
[
Wind whistling
]
Jake
: Whoa, good thing it sprinkled this morning, right? This tall, wet grass feels good on my legs.
Finn
: Huh, what? Who's that?
Jake
: I don't know. It looks like we should've skipped brunch. Early bird got the worm, and then the worm was
his
brunch.
Finn
: Our brunch was sick.
Jake
: Right. Now we got the calorie fuel to jump this fool.
Finn
: Oh, my truth, dude! Is that Betty?
Jake
: Betty's dead.
Finn
: Disappeared doesn't always mean dead.
Jake
: Eh, you're right. She looks alive.
Finn
: Alive and off the grid, snatching up glob remnants. I got a weird feeling in my fat basket. Like, what does she want with glob's helmet, and why has she got new glasses on?
Jake
: What do
we
want with glob's helmet?
Finn
: Dude, we're scavengers.
Jake
: Is that what we are? Okay, stealth mode.
Finn
: Oh, no, man!
Jake
: Magic man's house! Likely, he's got Betty under a mind-control spell!
Finn
: Shoot, man, I don't want to deal with this guy.
Jake
: He's a tough adversary, but if we hide in the trees, pinpoint his location, maybe you can sever his spine before he can do his magic on us.
Magic Man
: Good plan!
Jake
: Get the spine! Whoa!
Magic Man
: [
Laughs
] Whoa! [
Laughs again
] Babies!
Finn
: Ohh! There goes!
Magic Man
: Shh, shh! Peace. [
Sniffs
] [
Sighs
] Like a red, raw trash hatch. [
Laughs
] You're in luck! Come on! You get to rule over my house while I'm gone for the rest of forever right here on my shelf of special friends,
Margles
and
Tiny Manticore
.
Tiny Manticore
: You promised me
I
would rule!
Magic Man
: How can a coward rule the roost? You escaped once and came right back. How sad is that, huh?
Tiny Manticore
: You gave me some kind of hostage syndrome! I need therapy!
Magic Man
: Well, Finn and Jake are heroes, so try being more like them, why don't you? Peace! [ Chuckles ]
Tiny Manticore
: Finn and Jake?! What did you do?! You monster! [ Growls ] I would do something if I could! You hear me, magic man?! You hear me?!
Betty
: What's all that yelling?
Magic Man
: Little guy's sad to see me go.
Betty
: Well, there it is -- what remains of your brother, Glob.
Magic Man
: [ Singing ] What remains? Tell me what remains, some loser smashed out your brains... [ Abruptly returns to speaking voice] End of song.
Betty
: So, this thing's really gonna transmute you into the new glob?
Magic Man
: Of course, and then I'm gonna make it rain on Mars in a bad way. Fire up those ovens, honey! This is exciting!
Betty
: A little sad though, right?
Magic Man
: Which part?
Betty
: Your brother blowing up in space. Doesn't that mess you up?
Magic Man
: Nothing messes
me
up.
Betty
: I don't believe that. Like, who is Margles, and why is there a picture of her on your shelf? Something there connects to who
you
are and your magic.
Magic Man
: Someone shines a light into my dark-wizard matter, a way to unclose the circuit of Magic... Madness... and Sadness.
Betty
: That's right. M.M.S. Runs through
all
magic users. I hung out with scores of them, all displaying varying degrees of magic... madness... and sadness. Studying these symptoms could lead me to their underlying cause, and then I'll control the forces that hold sway over
Simon
.
Magic Man
: I see.
Betty
: You see what?
Magic Man
: The coconut crab who swims in your neighbor's pool at night. Maybe Simon's in there, too. Who
else
holds their breath in there, Betty?
Betty
:
All
magic users swim in the loomy gloom.
[Cut to upstairs on the shelf]
Tiny Manticore
: Finn and Jake, if you can hear me, listen! There's a lady downstairs. She thinks she can save her BF, Simon, by finding the source of magic, but she ain't gonna find Jack squat! Magic Man's using her! He's gonna make her a talking skateboard or something stupid like that! I can't help because I'm psychologically powerless! But you are heroes, and I believe in you! I believe! You hear me?! Please! [
Gasps
] Go Jake or...Finn! Which ever! Save her! Wait! No! Oh, Glob, I'm sorry! I didn't plan this out!
Magic Man
: Whew! Good pump! Fire's ablaze! Pump to failure -- that's what weightlifters say.
Betty
: So, what happens now? We sweat it out in a magic-induced trance. My essence marinates Glob's helmet with its ancient human DNA code, which should cause it to act as a sorcerer's stone for your transmutation into the Globhead.
Magic Man
: Which should allow
me
to activate my ancient martian transport.
Betty
: Is this gonna change you?
Magic Man
: Will it change
you
? And will you be hungry after? Why don't you finish baking your famous bread, huh?
[
Scene cuts back to upstairs on the shelf
]
Tiny Manticore
: This is your last chance! The dirt should break your fall, then it's up to you 'cause I'm ​useless. Go! Yes! [
Laughs
] Do it!
[
Scene cuts back to downstairs
]
Betty
: Bread's going...in.
​
Magic Man
: Hurry up, Betty. All the answers to your theories as our spirits meld.
Betty
: Okay, be right there! It's gonna get sweaty?
Magic Man
: The more skin mist, the ​better.
Betty
: So, you're not afraid of what I might see in you?
Magic Man
: No, dumb-dumb. You imagined the lock before the key. ​You think this is the key, but it's a waste basket. Flumes open!
Hissing
]
Betty
: We'll see.
Magic Man
: Smooth and gray as far as you ​can see. No life grows in me. Nothing to weed. Nothing to seed. Pure and perfect. Like the marble floors of a bank. You slide with no obstacles, forever blank.
[
Wind whistles
]
Betty
: Whoa. It really is like he said.​ Sort of cool, though.
The key. Whoa.
[ Soft rumbling ]
Aha!
Bingo!
Whoa!
[ Shouting indistinctly ]
[Gasps]
Margles? Open your eyes, Margles.
Who's that?
I'm Magic Man, and that's my sibling, Glob.
Hi.
Uh, could I talk to you a sec?
Okay. What's up?
That's ​ our new planetary defense system?
Yeah, Margles.
Margles is your wife, dude.
My wife was taken by
GOLB
.
[Growls softly]
This is like my tribute.
I'm gonna install her right there on Olympus Mons so she can protect us from GOLB.
But you named her after your wife.
Yeah, but it stands for "Magical Automated Resistance Generating Laser Energy Supplier."
Come again?
Whatever.
I wanted to call her Margles.
So, you used magic to make her, and you don't think your feelings for your lost wife might have compromised your
spell programming?
No, that's crazy.
Her appearance is just a symbol ​of Margles. ​
Why do I feel like this is ​the worst idea ever? ​
What a great idea going on ​this hike. ​
Why didn't you magic us up? ​
Uh, I guess I wanted to know ​more about you since I created ​you in a deep trance state. ​
All I am is in you, so know ​yourself, Magic Man. ​
Yeah, duh, okay. ​
To the top then! ​
Wa... Zaa! ​
Okay, then, ready to initiate ​the install? ​
Yes. ​
Wait, hold on. ​You should come back down. ​
I got to stop the second ​coming of GOLB. ​
Uh, he's probably not coming ​back. ​
I wish he would. ​Maybe I would see you ​again--original you.
I looked everywhere, you know.
So what?
Every dimension, every dead world.
I even wished you back in
Prismo
's
Time Room
.
[ Warbling ]
Balls, man, that has never happened before.
But you were gone, erased, only existing here...And  here. For hundreds of years, I held ​that sadness until my magic and ​science were strong enough to ​create you from my nightmares. ​
Then let me do what you built ​me for. ​
[ Gasps ] ​
I take it back! ​
Aah! ​
[ Rattling ] ​
Finn: [ Sighs ] ​
[ Shouts ] ​
Don't activate, Margles! ​
You came from me, so you got to​ understand!
I came from...[
Distorted voice
]...your nightmares!
[ Screaming ]
[ Electricity crackling ]
Finn:[
Grunts
] Unh!
[ Moaning]
[ Gasps ]
[ Shouting indistinctly ]
Ohh!
Unh!
Finn: [ Shouting ]
Unh!
[ Gasps ]
[ Moaning ]
Oomph!
[ Grunts ]
Wait, what's happening?!
Aah!
Finn: [ Grunts ]
[Breathing heavily]
[ Hissing ]
[ Moans ] What the...Oh, look, the bread's alive.
Betty, you see?!
I see a crab emerging from a dark pool.
Oh, yeah?
W-what does the crab say?
[ Rumbling in distance ]
Betty
: Aaaaah! [
Cackling
] Laters!
Normal Man
: Whoa. My sadness is gone, and my-- Ow! Hey!
Finn
: Murm, muph, maph.
Normal Man
: Do what?
Finn
: Murm, muph, maph.
Normal Man
: Turn you back?
Finn
: Meph!
Normal Man
: I can't. I think I'm just a normie now. Maybe someone in
Wizard City
can help. Ow!
Finn
: Maph, moh.
Normal Man
: Ow!
Tiny Manticore
: Finn, is that you and Jake?
Finn
: My, muh, mu, mimuh, mimuh.
Tiny Manticore
: Fly you to Wizard City? I can't!
Finn
: Meh, moo, mam! Moo, mah, mu, uh!
Tiny Manticore
: Thank you, heroes! You helped me find my courage!
Finn
: Mih, muh, mim, mo, muh.
Normal Man
: What do normies
do?
Get smoothies or something?
