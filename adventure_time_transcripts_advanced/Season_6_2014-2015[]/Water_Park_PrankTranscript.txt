Jake
: These anti-fog goggles work a treat.
Finn
: Yeah, but now they stink of dog breath. Guess what, though? When we get to the water park, I'm gonna be ready in super-quick time, because look I'm already wearing my swim trunks!
Jake
: I knew there was something different about you today. Oh, wait. Did you remember to pack your usual shorts and underwear for getting changed into after the water park?
Finn
: Carry on without me. I'll take a shortcut through the toadstool fields and get there before you!
Jake
: Heh, heh. I may have stinky dog breath, but at least I don't have to concern myself with underwear.
Finn
: At first I had no underwear But this time, I brought underwear I'm glad I remembered my underweaaaar! Oof! Because I feel creepy without it!
Princess Bubblegum
: Well done for remembering your underwear, Finn.
Finn
: It's a long story. You see, I forgot to bring shorts and underwear for after the water park, but then I went home and I got some.
Princess Bubblegum
: Oh, that's where I'm going. I take swimming lessons at the water park. Where's Jake?
Finn
: He's probably nearly there by now.
[Crying is heard]
Aww, don't cry. He'll be fine on his own till we get there.
Princess Bubblegum
: It's not me. Look!
[Princess Orangutan crying]
Princess Bubblegum
: Princess B'Orangutan, what's wrong?
Princess B'Onangutan
: Well, I'd been playing all morning when I noticed this puddle. I only wanted to rest and cool my legs down. But when I brought them back out of the water, they were covered in daddy-sad-heads!
Finn
: Yuck! Can't you just spin your legs around and send them all flying?
Princess B'Onangutan
: I can't. I'm too sad.
Princess Bubblegum
: Daddy-sad-heads secrete a tear toxin that makes the host too sad to get rid of them, even though all it would take is a good shake.
Finn
: Don't worry, Princess! I've got the perfect tool for the job. And I'm already in my swim trunks.
Princess Bubblegum
: No, wait! Don't go in the water!
Finn
: Ooh! [
cries
] Why am I crying?
Princess Bubblegum
: I just told you,it's a tear toxin. Were you not listening?
Finn
: I was half-listening.
Princess Bubblegum
: Did you hear the part about how they just need a good shake to get rid of?
Finn
: Yeah, but I don't want to shake them. What if I hurt them? [
sniffles
] Maybe they'll just have to stay on forever.
[
Both Finn and Princess B'Orangutan sob
]
[ groans ]
Ugh! This is miserable.
I know. I use visualization techniques with my swimming students all the time.
But I already know how to swim.
I know, but what if you visualize the daddy-sad-heads as little jingling bells or something?
And if you ring them, it'll cheer everybody up.
I don't see how a jingling bell would cheer anybody up, but I'll give it a try.
Jingle, jingle.
Nope, it didn't work. Next plan?
Okay, let's do this properly.
Shut your eyes and --keep that thing away from me!
Okay. When you open your eyes,
You're going to be the court jester in the court of king daddy-sad-head, and he's really sad.
[ moans sadly ]
So he needs you to do a dance in your funny jingle suit to cheer him up, okay?
[ sniffles ] Um, okay.
[ jingle! Jingle! Jingle! ]
Mm. I think it's working!
[ laughs ]
That's great, Finn. Keep it up!
Come with me, your majesty. Hup! Hey, where are you--
How do you like your new jingling jester chair?
[ both laugh ]
[ jingling ]
Ooh!
[ thud! ]
That visualization technique worked a treat!
Glad I could be of service.
Finn, as a token of my gratitude, please accept this reward.
It's a magic coin that can turn into any value of any currency you want.
Oh, cool!
Will it work in the lockers at the water park?
Well, yeah, I suppose so, but --
Nice one. Chuck it over.
Whoops!
Oh, wait. Jake's been waiting for ages.
What if he gives up on me and goes home?
Well, I can give you a lift if you're not afraid of flying.
Here I come, Jake!
Don't give up on me and go hoooome!
Don't worry about me, guys. I'm happy to walk.
[ rider screams ]
What's taking Finn so long?
Tell you what, he's got seven --six more minutes, and then I'm just heading in there without him.
I mean, I can't be expected to sit here all day waiting for --
Finn: Hey, Jake!
Ah, here he comes now.
Sorry I'm late. Uh!
I had to go --thanks again, Finn.
Bye! No problem. See you later!
Yeah, I had to rescue Princess B'Orangutan there.
But guess what? She gave me a reward that's going to come in very handy very soon.
Ohhh.
[ locks click ]
[ both giggle nervously ]
Look, I brought us two gold coins so we can have a locker each.
No way! Oww! What the heck?!
Sorry! I was just trying to stop you putting the coin in before I showed you my magical item.
Well, I hope it's a healing item after you just crimped my wrist with a metal door!
No, look.
It's a magic token that can fit in any slot.
Watch.
[ magical tinkling,coin clinks ]
We've saved ourselves two gold coins on lockers.
Well, not really, 'cause the lockers give you the coins back, anyway.
Yeah, but this way only one of us has to carry a key.
Yeah, but if we lock my locker, then lock my key in your locker, we would only have to carry one key, but we'd still have a whole locker each.
Yeah, but could we just use the reward I earned for being so brave and rescuing a princess, please?
Okay, fine.
Thanks very much.[ tink! ]
[ coins jingle ]
[ groans ]
[ ting! ]
[ chanting ] Water slide! Water slide! Water slide!
[ whistle blows ]
No running on poolside, guys.
And we ask that all pool users take a quick shower on the way in.
Cheers, guys.
Hey, guess what, dude?
See that big pile of ginger hair and dirty bubbles clogging the drain?
Yeah?
Well, that's your favorite snack of all time!
Yuck! No way, bro!
That's your favorite snack of all time!
Yuck! No way!
Yes, way!
Blech! Yuck!
[ both laughing ]
Ginger hair. That's gross.
[ chanting ] Water slide! Water slide! Water sliiiide!
[ footsteps ]
Okay, let's have one more go on the slide, then I am turning this waterpark into a frozen water park.
And if anyone doesn't like it, tough.
Hey, Ice King. Hey, Ice King.
Oh! Uh...Ha ha.
I didn't recognize you two there in your swimwear.
[ laughs nervously ]
Listen, guys, you'll get no trouble from me today.
I'm just enjoying a relaxing day off, okay?
Okay.
[ static crackles ]
Prank, prank, prank! Idea for prank!
Details for a prank!
[ laughs ]
Ahem!
Uh-oh! I've just lost my nerve.
Excuse me. Comin' through.
Ha ha, what a wimp.
Good! Now kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick!
Can I borrow one of these? Thank you!
Can I take one of these? Thank you.
[ splash! ]
[ whistle blows ]
Right, off you go.
Um, I just need to work up my courage.
[ breathing heavily ]
What a pair of absolute cowards.
[ chuckles ]
[ splash! ]
[ clang! Clang! Clang! ]
Okay, found my courage.
Aqua brakes!
[ both laugh ]
Okay, dude. You inflate yourself, but wait till I'm out of the --
[ thunk! ]
[ splash! Thud! ]
[ whistle blows ] Right. Next.
Okay, you ready?
[ echoing ] Here we goooo!
Hey! What just happened?
[ whistle blows ]
Could I ask you not to climb back up the slide, sir?
Just ride it all the way to the bottom. Thanks.
I didn't do anything!
One minute I was on my way down, and the next I'm back up here!
All right, let's try that one again, shall we?
Here we goooo!
[ bounce! ]
Now, hold on a minute.[ whistle blows ]
It's too dark to see, but there must be a--a trampoline or something stuck in the tunnel bouncing me back up.
Very funny, sir. I think I would've noticed someone bringing a trampoline into the slide.
Listen, you've got one more chance to slide down properly, okay? There are other people waiting.
What's the big hold up? [ giggles ]
What are you laughing at?
You're something to do with this!
It's them! Where's that dog?
He can, like, go stretchy and turn into things.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Jake's up there sitting in the viewing gallery.
Look. And he's reading a pamphlet.
[ giggles ]
Hmmm...Keep your eyes on that dog.
Here we go.
[ bounce! ]
[ echoing ] Oh, come on!
Dog didn't move a muscle, sir.
Let's see if it works for me. Hey!
Here comes Finn![ whistle blows ]
No running and no queue jumping!
[ finn and jake laugh ]
[ splash! ]
Nice work with the pamphlet, by the way.
[ chuckles ] It was just an extra detail.
I'll go get rid of the decoy.
[ creak! ]
[ chortles ]
Well, that boy didn't seem to have any trouble sliding down.
Did you miss us?
[ finn and jake laugh ]
I don't now how you did it, but you'd better own up and stop making a fool of me!
[ whistle blows ]
Right! That's it!
I can't have you assaulting other pool users.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now, sir.
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to freeze now, sir!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[ fizzling ] What?
Hey, the water's turned my fingers too pruny to do magic!
[ static crackles ] Come in.
Yeah, there's an old guy lost the plot at the top of the slide.
I'm getting the duty manager involved.
Fine, get him involved!
But I'm not leaving until you carry out a full investigation of this slide and question that pair as prime suspects!
Sorry, got to fly!
Jake: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
[ whistle blows ] No sliding on the stairs!
For goodness sake!
Are you about ready to go, Jake?
Yeah, just need to fold up my towel.
And a lifetime ban means we'll be keeping a picture of you behind reception in case you try to come back.
Well, why don't you blow that picture up poster sized, frame it on the wall, and add a touch of class to this dump!
Ha ha! That's good one.
Oh, if you like that one, you'll love this one!
That's your favorite snack of all time!
[ squelch! ]
[ splat! ]
Man: Get him out of here!
[ ice king laughs evilly ]
[ sizzling ]
Both: thanks, sun!
Did you guys have fun at the water park?
Yes and no. But mostly yes.
Did you teach any kids to swim?
As a matter of fact --[ finn groans ]
Are you okay, Finn?
Yeah, sorry.
This orangutan hair is inside my hood.
I need to flush them out in that puddle.
No, wait![ splash! ]
That's the same puddle from before!
[ grunts ] Look, guys!
My new court-jester hat arrived!
But it feels a bit too tight.
Jingle, jingle!
[ laughing ]
[ all gasp ]
[ crying ]
