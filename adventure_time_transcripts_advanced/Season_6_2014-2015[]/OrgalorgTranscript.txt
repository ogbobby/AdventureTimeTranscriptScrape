[In the Ice Kingdom. Ice King is sitting in a chair and knitting pink "yamakas"]
Ice King:
[Chortles] Oh man, these things are gonna make me rich. It's like a big yamaka for the tummy. [Disconnects yarn and stands up]. Hmm. I think I'll keep this one for myself. [Wraps yamaka around stomach and ties on the back] [Giggles] Haute couture! Hmmm... [Pulls up mirror from behind beard and examines the yamaka] Nice! Ooh, a little roomy. When did that happen? I am wasting away! I should probably go polish off that cheesecake in the fridge! [Grabs two yamakas, puts them on feet to use as footwear, and exits room]
Penguins:
*Distant* [Conversing]
Ice King:
Hmm... [Walks up to fridge, opens the door. A bunch of penguins are inside it, standing around a piece of cheesecake with a sleeping gas grenade lodged in the middle] Oh!
Penguins:
[Two of them talk to each other, then snicker]
Ice King:
Now what are you guys up to? Ah, here's my man, Gunter. [Gunter is seen in the back of the fridge, hiding several sleeping gas grenades] You're hanging with a bad crowd, Goonts. Alright guys, let me just rescue my cheesecake, and my Goonts. [Reaching for Gunter] *Grunt* Come - *Grunt* Oh there you are!
Penguins:
[Laughs]
Ice King:
[Closes fridge door] A little Gunter, a little cheesecake... [walks up to counter, grabs fork] ...and a little fork! [Walks back to knitting chair] You know what Guntie, I am gonna take my time with this delicious cake. Take it reeeal slow. [Cuts off an edge of the cheesecake with the fork and eats it] Mmm... Wheeew, getting full. Alright, maybe just another teeny corner. [Cuts off another corner, eats it.]
Gunter:
[Flails with arms towards the cheesecake]
Ice King:
What's wrong, Gunter? [Picks up Gunter] Does Gunter want some cheesecake too? Nooo. Cheesecake is not for penguins silly Gunter. Nooo, nooo.
Gunter:
*Stubbornly* Wenk.
Ice King:
[Puts down Gunter] You win this round, Mr. Cheesecake! I'll just clean up a few crumbs and leave the rest for tomorrow. [Gathers crumbs with fork] I've had enough for one day.
Gunter:
[Removes sleeping gas safety pin, and stuffs it in Ice Kings mouth]
Ice King:
Ah! [The sleeping gas begins to flow out] Gunter! [Yawns big, and smacks lips] *Sleepily* Hooh, my little pal. Gunter, I love- [Falls asleep]
Gunter:
[Looks at Ice King, shrugs] Wenk. [Jumps off chair, walks away and up a staircase] Wenk Wenk Wenk!
Bow Penguin:
[Enters the room] Wenk Wenk.
[Lots of penguins enter the room, and begin to spread out through the rooms. Three penguins walk over to Ice King's drum set and one begins drumming. Several penguins walk up to Ice King, grab gim and carry him away into another room and place him on a bed. Several penguins grab bottles from the fridge. Some penguins gather around Ice King's keyboard. One sings into a microphone, and another plays the keyboard. Lots of penguins, along with
Hand Snow Golem
] are gathered in a big room, holding drinks and conversing]
Bow Penguin:
[Opens Phone. The previous message reads 'HOUSE PARTY!!' They send 'IK FORT'. The receiver is revealed to be
Lumpy Space Princess
], as she replies with "I'M ALREADY HERE *=)" Bow Penguin sees her from across the room, waving]
[The penguin at the drum set is playing vigorously in front of a crowd of three penguins. The penguin at the keyboard is still playing, and three penguins are seen dancing atop it, as well as another bystander penguin. Two penguins run through the mass of others]
Bow Penguin:
*To Lumpy Space Princess* Wank Wank Wank!
Lumpy Space Princess:
[Laughs] That's so true, I
Am
the prettiest one here!
[Three penguins are seen singing in harmony, one holding a fish. Another penguin holding a fish talks seductively to a large ice spike, then kisses it. Many penguins are gathered around a hole in which two Walruses,
Walrus 5
and
Walrus 1
, are racing. Several penguins throw fish on the ground in front of a penguin wearing a golf visor. The penguin drags in the fish with a hockey stick.]
Lumpy Space Princess:
[Holding several fish in her hands] Come on number five! [Goes over to the golf visor penguin] Five on number five to win! [Throws fish on ground] I feel lucky! [Returns to the hole] Come on number five! Wh- ? I've got a lot of money riding on you to win, you jerk! [Grabs a hockey sticks] Come on, you slug! [Hits Walrus 5 with the stick] Ugly, dumb walrus! [Walrus bites hockey stick] Aaaah! *In Walrus 5's mouth* What did I do to deserve this? Gunter! Gunter help! I'm your guest of honor!
Gunter:
[Notices Lumpy Space Princess, and runs to help her]
Lumpy Space Princess:
Gunter help! *To Walrus 5* I'm a princess, dummy! Get your mouth off me!
Gunter:
[Slaps Walrus 5, Grabs Lumpy Space Princess. Several penguins cheer from the crowd]
Lumpy Space Princess:
*Smiling* Gunter! [Frowns, and hits Gunter's hand] Don't touch my stomach. [Goes away]
Walrus 5:
[Roars]
Gunter:
[Notices Walrus 5] Wenk! [Looks at Walrus] Wenk? [Sees a vision of the purple version of the
Catalyst Comets
] in place of Walrus 5. His eyes light up and show Orgalorg's face. He opens his arms to embrace it. Walrus 5 chomps on him, and he gets stuck in its mouth. Two penguins wearing clown costumes enter the pit and distracts Walrus 5, who proceeds to toss Gunter away. Gunter hits his head on an ice spike and presumably blacks out]
[Gunter is shown in first person perspective, most likely in the near future walking past several penguins looking at him. The penguins move out of the way as he walks forward. Lumpy Space Princess is seen in the crowd, fainting when Gunter approaches. Gunter is shown to have a green brain protruding from his forehead. The brain vibrates, and Gunter sees a vision of several unknown planets. All of the other penguins, along with the Hand Snow Golem, leave the room and ascend the stairs, one dragging Lumpy Space Princess behind them. Gunter's brain vibrates again, and he sees another vision, this time of a wooden cutout of
Abraham Lincoln
. He enters a woodworking room behind Ice King's knitting chair, and walks down a stairway. At the bottom there is a stash of wooden tools and planks.
Kitten
is seen sleeping in the room, and wakes up and runs away when Gunter approaches. Gunter pulls out a bandsaw from behind the wooden tools. Again his brain vibrates, and he sees a vision of the purple catalyst comet. He grabs a bunch of planks and proceeds to cut out several figures using the bandsaw. After finishing cutting out the figures he exits the room and places them on the floor standing up. His brain vibrates once more]
Gunter:
*Continuously* Weeeeeenk. [A series of unknown symbols are shown lighting up on a dark background. Gunter forms an light beam in a bow between his hands in the air. The wooden figures light up with symbols, accompanied with a strange noise. A similar bow is connected between the furthest two figures. This beam continues from each of the figures, until it reaches Gunter's own "light bow," and the beam of light is blasted into the air. The beam is seen travelling out of Ice King's castle, away from the Earth and into the cluster of unknown planets seen in one of his previous visions. The beam envelops one of the planets with a green and yellow surface]
Green Alien:
The signal! The signal! We haven't had a communication from Orgalorg in thousands of years! He must be mad at us! Everybody kneel! Everybody kneel!
Dad Alien:
Better do as he says, kids.
Child Alien:
Mommy, who's Orgalorg?
Mom Alien:
Oh, well, eh...
Dad Alien:
Um... Uh, to be honest, we though he was just a myth your stupid grandparents told us so we wouldn't make out.
Elder Alien 1:
Yes! And you should have listened! [Two aliens are seen entering the area, both seated in a transportation devices]
Mom Alien:
*Pointing at the aliens* The elders!
Dad Alien:
Yes, the elders! *Pointing at the aliens* The elders!
Elder Alien 1:
We told you! Orgalorg is real. And horrifying!
Elder Alien 2:
But nobody would listen! You all just wanted to make out!
Dad Alien:
Uh, well, we're listening now.
Elder Alien 1:
After you had kids and they didn't want to listen to you, how did that make you feel?
Mom Alien:
Terrible.
Elder Alien 1:
Exactly. Anyway, so, makeouts.
Elder Alien 2:
Orgalorg.
Elder Alien 1:
Oh. Orgalorg is an ancient cosmic entity, who ruled the solar system with his cruel and deadly whims. [A depiction of Orgalorg is shown against a dark background, along with several stars, circles and crescent moons. A flashback is shown of Orgalorg throwing a giant boulder at a village in green mountains above clouds] The breaker of worlds, he was seeking evermore power. He desired to intercept a catalyst comet and absorb its essence. [A flashback is shown of Orgalorg flying through space with an orange catalyst comet in the background. He wraps one of his arms around the comet flying in the background] Thereby did he offend the king of mars, who decreed that Orgalorg should be cast down. And yes he was cast down, by the flaming sword of
Grob Gob Glob Grod
. [A flashback is shown of Grob Gob Glob Grod swinging a flaming blue sword at Orgalorg, who falls down towards the Earth] Orgalorg was banished to an inhospitable planet where he would forget everything. Yay, even forget his identity, and from whence he came.
Elder Alien 2:
[Clears throat] And the prophets say that the gravity of the planet did crush and compress Orgalorg into a more powerless and cuddlesome form. *Spookily* Oooooh! [A flashback is shown of a black silhouette of Orgalorg diminishing in shape and size, eventually resembling that of Gunter]
Elder Alien 1:
But now he's back. And whose fault is that? Makeouts.
Green Alien:
Behold! It is he! Orgalorg reaches out from the void! [A green wavy line in the sky, caused by Gunters light beam, changes shape into an outline of Gunters face]
Gunter:
*Echoing* Wenk! [The aliens on the planet scream in fear. The faces and screaming of the reacting aliens travel with the beam back down to Earth, where Gunter examines them]
Ice King:
[In his bed, waking up] Huh? Goonter? [Looks around for Gunter]
Gunter:
*In distress, continually* Wenk! Wenk! Wenk! [Gunter puts his hans on his head, cancelling the light bow. He grabs an icicle from the roof and begins smashing the wooden figures, breaking the beam travelling between them, and removing the symbols lighting up on them] *Panting* [Gunter sees a seres of visions of his life after arriving on Earth:]

Ice King:
Gunter! That's a bad boy, Gunter! [The room is filled with wood shrapnel, icicle shards and discarded cups and glasses] You wrecked daddy's stuff again. [Grabs Gunter] Some of your stuffing is peeking out. [Walks over to knitting chair and sits down, grabbing knitting sticks] Okay Gunter, let's just... [Using the rounded edge of the stick, he pokes Gunter's brain back into his head] Boop.. Beep... Bip... Bop... And a bandage! [Wraps some yarn around Gunters head] See? You're practically back to normal my little Goonts! [Grabs a mirror and shows Gunter] Here, take a look for yourself. Not bad Guntie. Not bad at all. [Gunter sees his reflection morph into a twisted grin, and then his mouth into an eye, creating Orgalorg's face, while Ice King laughs in the background
