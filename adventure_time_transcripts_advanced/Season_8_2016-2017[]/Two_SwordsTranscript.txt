[ Chuckles ]We'll see.
Honestly, though,
this doesn't even feelthat weird now.
I mean, maybe it's 'causeit already happened
once before,but, I don't know.
It feels like normal,I guess.
[ Banana Guard clears throat ]
I mean, I knowit's "serious."
[ Groans ]Jake and Susanand Rattleballs
all gotpretty banged up.
But for me,I guess it's like...
I don't know.It feels right or something.
What's weird, though,is that grass guy.
Kinda rubs methe wrong way, that one.

with the two of youthis morning.

Then it ran offand merged butts
with my Finn Sword...
