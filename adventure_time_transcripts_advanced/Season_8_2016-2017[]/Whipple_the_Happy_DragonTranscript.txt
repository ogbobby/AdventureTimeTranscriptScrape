So...if that's where we started
and this is the water
and this is where the humans are,
then we must be aroooound...
here.
Jake: Oh, no! Giant Finn hand straight ahead!
[ Imitates crash ]
Jake!
That's not how you navigate, man.
Yeah, I know.
But, what do you expect?
I was afraid of the ocean for, like, forever.
Relax. I'm a regular sea dog.
Just gotta measure the angle of the sun
using my pocket sextant...
then do some super‐complicated calculations...
[ Mutters ]
...and some plotting.
And, voilà! We got a course ‐‐
straight through the Sea of Sure Death.
Susan, we've got a course!
Whoo!
Both: Whoo!
All: Whoo!
Susan feel alive.
Ahh!
Mm.
[ Dolphin chatters ][ Laughs ]
Cool.
♪ El‐le‐fly, el‐le‐fly,emerge from the chrysalis ♪
♪ Flyyyy ♪
[ Screaming ]
Someone!
[ Gasps ]
Majestic animal in distress!
Let's go! Let's go! Turn left!
That's gonna take us off course.
Uh, helping people comes first.
[ Screaming ]
[ Angry grumbling ]We don't like you!
You make us uncomfortable!
Susan does not thinkthis is a good idea.
What?!Yeah, Susan.
What if those people need to slay lizard to feed babies?
Yeah, man, then it'd be like
you're the slayer of babies.
[ Sighs ]So, it's up to Finn
to stop that ship all by his self.
Catapult me, Jake.
Sea lizard make scary storm magic.
[ People screaming ]
We're gonna die!
We deserved that.
See? Not good idea.
Hello! Yoo‐hoo!
Hi.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry about your boat.
I was just trying to get rid of those weirdos.
Sorry.
My name's Whipple, by the way.
Um, I'm Finn the human.
Susan.
And I'm the bad boy, Jake.
Were they after your shiny, shiny pelt, Whipple?
No, they saidI was annoying.
All: What?
That is so mean.
I don't know what it is.
I mean, I see those guys aroundall the time.
I thought they were cool.
Uh‐oh. I lost the sextant.
Does that mean we're lost?
It means I can't determine our current posi‐‐
Ooh! Ooh! Let me see!
You trying to get to this island?
Pssh, I know where that is. I can totally get you there.
Without instruments?
I got fish senses.
Yeah, okay. That sounds good.
Good lizard.
[ Gasps ]You guys are so cool!
You're cool, Mr. Navigator.
[ Giggles ]
Whipple, you're the greatest.
Okay, so, but here's the really clever part, okay?
Squirrel girl wakes up and realizes she's alone.
Squirrel boy never existed.
It was all a dream. Cool, right?
Whipple, you suck so much.
And I'm thinking the next novel in the series
will center around a married cat
who has an extra‐marital crush on a handsome ape, Stanley.
Or maybe Stanley's too close to "Dan Lee."
That's from my screenplay about a hot turtle couple
who go on a cross‐country road trip as a last resort
to save their marriage.
But then, they find out they're actually gophers.
Anyway, I'm really excited about my kids' book, too.
It's kind of a sad story about these anthropomorphic
salt and pepper shakers who've been BFFs for life,
but Pepper starts developing feelings for Salt,
and basically, Salt never
[muffled] returns them and ends up marrying
[normal]another guy, so Pepper
[muffled] starts writing stories to try to distract himself.
It's semi‐autobiographical ‐‐
Stooop!!
BMO?! BMO?!
You stowed away?
Who cares?!Give me the earplugs!
Both: Shh!
Wait. Are you guys wearing earplugs?
Uh...I mean, we were, but it was
'cause of the engine noise, not 'cause of you.
It is because of you!
BMO. He needs to be told.
No one wants to hear your ideas!
I see. I thought you guys were my friends,
but you're all just a bunch of haters!
[ All screaming ]
Nice one, Jake.
I don't want to be the boat, though.
Well...
you're the boat.
Yeah, I know.
Might as well go full sloop then.
All right. Jake‐boat away!
Away! Away!
Uh, dude, I got no idea where to head.
BMO, don't you have some kind of navigation app?
No.
Oh, wait. Yes, I do.
[ Plink! ]
What next, BMO?
Cap'N Nav app says look for a rock shaped like a chubby cat.
That looks like cat.
Full steam ahead.
[ Fart! ]
[ Laughter ]Not like that!
[ Gasps ]
Mom? Dad?
All: Whoa!
Jake, this is the wrong way!
What are you guys doing out there?
Jake‐boy, you gotta save your pop from the deadly sea!
I don't care for this cocktail party one bit, Joshua.
We got to save 'em.
What are you looking at?
Don't you see Mom and Dad?
All I see is sea weeds. You must be imagining it.
I'm not imagining it!
Uh‐oh! We are headed towards a scary thing!
Susan, help me push the boom.
[ Both grunting ]
No!
[ Strains ]
Use your core!
Both: Aaaaaah!
No!
Remember we love you!
Even though you're really letting us down.
Aah!
Hmm?
Yipes!
Jake keep talking about dog‐mom.
His belly's swarming with weird jellyfish.
They must be jacking up his perception.
[ Both gasping ]
Mommy, I'm coming for you!
Huh? What happened?
[ Gasps ]Who are you?
Hope you like to fly!
You okay?
Uh...Susan's head hurts,
but Susan's head always hurting these days.
All right. Just another minor setback.
BMO, which way?
Finn, I want to turn back.
What? We can't.
The annoying dragon wrecked our boat,
I got poisoned by jellyfish and saw our dead parents.
I don't see things deescalating.
It's just a small bump ‐‐
a‐a bunch of small bumps.
No dumb island can be worth the risk.
Maybe not. But I can't turn back.
This trip means a lot to you, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, but why?
Do you want to find some humans and ditch us?
No! It's just...[ Sighs ]
Okay, look ‐‐I'm really happy in Ooo.
I love our mom and dad,
but I don't know squat about humans.
If I don't see this through, part of me will always be stuck
to that boom boom leaf where Mom found me...still alone.
I know exactly how you feel.
All: Aah!
You were here all this time?
Yeah, I was here all this time.
SorryI broke your boat.
Sorry we said you were annoying,
or sorry for not telling you you were annoying earlier.
If you're still set on going to that island,
you should know that that way is crazy dangerous.
I'm...I'm ready.
All: Us, too.
Then, I can use my air bladder to blow a mighty wind,
a real big wind that'll carry you over all the dangers.
How come you didn't do that earlier?
I thought we were having fun.
Also, they say no one's faced the island's colossus and lived.
What colossus?!
Beware. Beware the colossus of the deep.
That's not really an answer, but we will.
Here we go.
[ Inhales deeply ]Wait a minute!
Byeee!
(They fly over the Poison Reef)
Jake: Whoa!
(They fly over a strange gap in the ocean)
BMO: That's not right.
(They fly over spikes made of ???)
Aah!
Spooky.
But at least I don't see no colossus of the deep.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my glob!
[ All screaming ]
