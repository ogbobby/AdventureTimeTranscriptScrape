Is it 'causeyou lost your arm again
and it got replacedwith a metal one?
No.The arm's cool.
Is it...
'cause you got,like, a grass clone
that lives on our roof?
No. That's fine.
[ Chewing ]Um, is it...
[ Munches ]

and put herin the hospital?

We'll just find youa new favorite food.
[ Fan squeaking ]

that being out of controllike that was so scary and ‐‐
and painful.
And that's howyou must've felt
after your brain jazzgot fried by that eel
and he went bonkerson everyone.
I wasn't strong enoughto stop you.
In a way,this is all my fault.
