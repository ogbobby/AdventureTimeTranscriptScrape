(SNORING)
(SNORING LOUDLY)
(SNORING LIGHTLY)
Oh, it's you. Meh. Meh.
(SLOW MOTION) Hi, everyone! My babies!
(POWER SAW WHIRRING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Mashed Potato? Pie Pie?
(SNORING) (SNORING LIGHTLY)
Tree Trunks:
(LAUGHS) Okay, bye!
Hey, where'd you go?
Tree Trunks:
I think I was visited by aliens again. Every few years, they stop by and show me my hybrid children. (LAUGHS) What? Don't be jealous of my alien consorts, Mr. Pig. I love you the most. (CHUCKLES)
All right, sweetie. Thank you. (SMOOCHES) You gonna come with me to Princess Bubblegum's fireworks show tomorrow?
Tree Trunks:
No, she wizzed on our wedding. I'm sorry, but she's a fat fish in the sand.
Mr. Pig:
I want to see free fireworks, though, and I want you to come with me.
Tree Trunks:
Eh, all right. (SMACK! SQUEAL!)
(MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS)
Science rules! Here's some proof.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
I'm doing the right thing.
(WARBLING) Free fireworks! Right! Here we go!
(APPLAUSE)
(WHIR!)
(WHISTLE!) (LAUGHING)
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!
Mr. Pig:
Hey, where's my wife?
(SLOW MOTION) What's that? Meh.
(HISS!) (CHATTERING)
(BEAT-BOXES TECHNO BEAT)
Tree Trunks:
Oh! Hey, you blind, cream-faced, lonely lighthouse keeper. Stop hurting my space men with your goo!
What?
How did you keep your probes out of my star children.
Tree Trunks, you don't know what you're talking about.
Don't you condescend to me, you false idol. You probed the wrong famiglia! (TWINKLE!) Wake up. The fireworks show is a secret space war. Get your goo out of my UFO.
Dude, this town is full of kooks.
Save the galactic chitlins!
Oh!
Meet Starchy in that alley over there.
Cacaw! Cacaw!
I'll just ask this duck.
Excuse me, but Don't be alarmed. I am the disembodied voice of the people, and I have witnessed your fire.
If given the opportunity, would you lead a small group of resistance fighters straight into the hornet's den?
You bet your wet booty.
Behold! It's me, Starchy!
Oh. (WHIR!)
Both:
Aaaaah! Unh!
Starchy always screams.
This is very elaborate!
Hello, everyone. We have a new member with us here tonight. Please welcome Train Tracks.
All:
Welcome, Train Tracks!
Veritas Brigade!
Train Tracks has her own incredible story to tell, so let's let her talk.
Hi, Train Tracks, I am a conduit for an alien entity known as Booshy. There is a 50/50 chance that Booshy will speak through me during this meeting.
(GASPS)
Oh, my gosh, it's happening.
(GRUNTING) I love when Booshy shows up.
F-F-F (DEEP VOICE) It's Booshy. Hello!
All:
Welcome, Booshy.
On my planet, we speak in colors instead of words.
Aw, stuff it, Booshy. We've got a real experiencer in our midst.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
Do y'all have any guns?
Nope.
Raaah! I don't have time for campfire stories. I'm a mother of six, and they're in trouble because Princess Bubblegum's probing them. Will you help me raise a ruckus?
All:
Of course we will! Let's stink it up!
What in the-- Oh, my gracious. A full-scale galactic invasion? Well, let's see how well you fly without your thing. Aaaah! (WHIR!)
Oh, good night! You're the devil's hot little helpers. Come get extinguished!
Princess Bubblegum:
What the funge, Tree Trunks?!
Girl, you just crossed the big line! Well, this is the people's justi-i-i Holy! i-i-ice.
(SLOW MOTION) What should I do?
Booshy's only prison is this wicked planet.
Yeah, well, join the club.
(WHIR!)
(SLOW MOTION) What? Tree Trunks! What is this place?
You already know.
(GASPS)
See? They refuse to fight back.
(RETCHING) (GRUNTS)
What? What?! What?!!
See, I told you.
What?!
Space men.
Princess Bubblegum:
I'm really sorry, Tree Trunks. I never meant to hurt anybody with my space program. It was supposed to seed new candy kingdoms on uninhabited planets in case Ooo goes straight up dongbongles. 'Cause, like, confidentially, there's a lot of ways that could happen. And when it does, maybe I won't look so crazy after all, you know?
I can help you find a space for your goo.
You would do that?
You and I will never be friends, but we can respect each other as mothers and as fellow believers in the infinite promise of the cosmos above.
Sure.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Oh, hello, darling.
Hello.
You can talk?
Yeah, there are websites that teach you. I wanted to tell you that I did what you said. We're going to fly Princess Bubblegum's probes back to our abandoned home planet. They'll have all the space they need to start their new Candy Kingdom. But our galaxy is so far away; I won't see you again for at least 40 years.
Take care of our alien babies.
Who the slop is this?!
This is my alien husband.
