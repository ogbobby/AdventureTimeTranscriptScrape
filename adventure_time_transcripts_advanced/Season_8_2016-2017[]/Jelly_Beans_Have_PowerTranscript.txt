[ Laughs ]
And then I was like, "There's a slime and place for everything."
And they were all, "OMG,
you're the greatest slime elemental ever!"
[ Laughs ]
Too bad you didn't invite Patience St. Pim to this party celebrating my new powers.
It's not to celebrate your ‐‐
Wait, Patience is totally nutcakes!
She kidnapped us and messed with our molecules.
Uhh, so what? She gave us these groovy powers.
East coast slime!
West coast slime!
Booty Sliiiime!
Stop sliming everything! No one likes it!
Oh, hey, Princess.
We were just wondering where all this rad slime was coming from.
Keep on slimin' it, SP!
[ Scoffs ] Thanks for nothin'.
Okay, great seeing you and your secretions!
[ Kick! ] I'll call you.
[ Whoosh! ]
Slime and plaaaace!
There's a slime and place for everything.
[ Grunts ]
[ Pbht! ]
[ Electricity crackles ]
Huh?
Princess?
What are you doing here so late?
Heyyy, buddy!
Yeah, just doin' some casual science jazz.
Show me your hand, young lady.
Fine.
I was trying to chart my candy power
to figure out why it's so garbage.
[ Pbht! ]
But its garbageness is uncrackable.
Things were fine before jellybeans
were farting out of my palms.
Don't give in to nostalgia, Princess.
Now, imagine this plate is an enemy of the kingdom.
You sleep with a plate?
The whole kingdom's looking at you to beat it.
You're gonna shoot it with streams of powerful candy,
and it's gonna blow their freaking minds.
Okay.
[ Grunting ]
Thanks for tryin', Peps.
I'm gonna call it a night.
[ Wind whistling ]
Brrr!
Huh?
What's this?
Eh, probably just an ad.
[ Yawns ]
Sweetings, Bubgum!
[ Squishing ]
Oh, this floor is stickier than it looks.
Did someone lick this?
Um, who are you?
No, I'm Chatsberry ‐‐the candy.
You're an older version of the candy elemental.
Exactly!
Did you feel that knowledge in your cosmic consciousness?
Nah. I just guessed.
Oh. But why aren't you using your powers?
This power stinks, man. There's nothing to it.
There's everything to it!
Candy's one of the building blocks of life.
It's in our very DNA.
Take this soft drink, for example.
Add some Scotch mints to it, and behold!
Hey, how did you do that?
I can barely shoot one jellybean.
Here, let me show you.
Connect to yourself.
I am connected to myself.
Not to the self you once were, to your new self.
[ Crying ]
[ Alarm rings ]
[ Zing! Alarm stops ]
I'll be globbed!
Okay.
Now aim and, jellybean!
Pow! Milk ball!
Pow! Candy corn!
Pow!
Those were all jellybeans but still, really good.
Call Slime Princess!
[ Laughs ]
And everyone was cheering so much for me.
I was like, "Applaud quieter."
[ Laughs ]
Say, how about some sugar for your tea?
Uh yeah, sure.
Allow me.
By the beard of Elder Plops!
This is cool, but...
[ Straining ]I said, allow...me!
[ Gasps ]You're welcome.
Okay, we've established we both have elemental powers.
So we never have to talk or brag about them again.
Brag? Wait, are you jelly of my slime?
Your slime is overrated.
I guess your real elemental power is envy!
Bye, hater!
[ Teacups clatter ]
I don't think this is really about slime.
Maybe.
It's just that the candy kingdom's supposed to be a reflection of me.
But it turns out, I don't know who that is.
I've lived my whole life while having this talent I knew nothing about.
I'm a scientist and I ignored crucial data about myself.
What if I ‐‐
[ Alarm buzzing ]
Wait! We were so close to a breakthrough!
I don't have time for breakthroughs.
♪♪
[ Gasps ]
Run, Skibbles!
All: Princess Bubblegum! Princess Bubblegum!
[ Screaming ]
You see what I mean?
This is what I have to deal with.
Hup!
Hey, Crystal Entity!
Kindly state your business before the Princess!
Pick a number.
This is some weak first‐grader magician we're dealing with.
Only a real idiot would fall for this guy.
Four!
Yeah, four!
[ All chanting "Four" ]
Guys!
One, two, three, four.
[ All gasping ]
[ Screaming ]
No!
Hurray for Princess Bubblegum!
Hurray for Bubblegum!
Heck yeah!
[ Cheering ]
Come on, Peps.
Ka‐kaw!
[ Whoosh! ]
[ Cheering ]
So majestic!
Pick a number.
How about a billion jellybeans in your face!
Uh‐oh.
[ Slow‐motion screaming ]
Oh, shoot.
Try a more powerful attack.
Do a gobstopper.
[ Grunts ]
That's just more beans!
[ Grunting ]
[ Pop! ]
[ Clang! ]
Okay, those were still jellybeans.
[ Screaming ]
[ Groans ]
Hey, that's ‐‐ that's the thing.
Whoa!
Sweetings, Bubblegum.
Chatsberry! Great timing!
Poke my brain again and unlock that mint‐soda explosion.
[ Slurps ]
I can open the door for you,
but you have to step through it yourself, and walk in your own shoes.
I mean, choose your own path.
My kingdom is under attack!
[ Slurps ]
You're as useless as my stinkin' powers.
[ Grunts ]
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
I had a path!
My path was science because science makes sense!
[ Groans ]If I was in my lab,
I could fabricate that explosion in a snap.
What explosion?
It was just regular soda pop and Scotch mints.
That shouldn't be hard. It's all sugar, right?
Right.
To make soda pop,
I'd need to add water and carbon dioxide.
And for the mints, gum Arabic, gelatin, potassium benzoate.
Add heat and pressure...
[ Ting! ]
I did it!
Chatsberry, I'm walking in my own shoes!
What?
Look!
[ Cheering ]
You're doing it!
You're blowing their freaking minds!
Now let's blow his mind.
Finishing move!
Ha ha, yes!
So cold.
Oh, no.
[ Both scream ]
No more boom!
It's just soda.
I'm not gonna...
I'm sorry.
[ All moaning ]
Banana guards, get the wounded to the infirmary!
I'll be in my quarters if, uh, if anyone needs me.
Okay. Hang on now.
Don't forget my jelly filling!
Oh, my goodness.
[ Banana guard imitates siren wailing ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Gobbling ]
Yee! Stop that now!
That crystal stuff will grind your guts!
Huh?
Wait, it's just snow?
[ Sighs ]
[ Zing! ]
Ow!
[ Sighs ]
[ Whistling ]
[ Smooches ]
[ Whistling continues ]
Man: Hey, will you keep it down down there!
Some of us have to work tomorrow!
