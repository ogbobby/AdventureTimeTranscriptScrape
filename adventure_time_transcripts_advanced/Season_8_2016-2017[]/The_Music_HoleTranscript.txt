You're a lovely singer.
[Giggles] Really?No one's ever said that.
Shut up.‐It's true!
Well, I've, uh, hada lot of practice ‐‐
1,000 yearsgive or take.
Say what?!
Yeah, I've been here singingfrom the very beginning of Ooo.
Since I can't movefrom this spot,
singing is my only outlet.
I can neither participate in joynor prevent disaster,
so I sing.
Is this likeone of those patterns
that's supposed to havea 3‐D image in it,
and everyone can see itexcept you?
Well, why can'tthey hear you?
Music Hole: Only two kindsof people can hear my song,
those who see the worldwith pure, childlike wonder
and those with a deep senseof loss in their hearts.
To everyone else,I'm just a period in a sentence
in the book of Ooo.
I don't knowabout child eyes,
but I have been goingthrough a rough patch.
Finn: And it sounds likeyou have, too.
Yeah, I guess so.
