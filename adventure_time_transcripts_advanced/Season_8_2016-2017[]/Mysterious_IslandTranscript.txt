[The episode starts with
Finn
laying on a beach at the shore of an
unknown island
he washed up on. Gulls
squawk]
[The ground rumbles]
Finn
:
[Groans and coughs. He stands up with his back turned toward the shore and coughs some more]
[Giant wave rises]
Finn
:
[Turns around and runs away]
Jake
?!
Susan
?!
BMO
?!
[Finn climbs up cliff and the wave crashes over him. The water sinks]
Finn
:
[Coughs. He spots a red and a blue crab]
Oh, hey there, fellas. Have you by any chance seen a cool dog or a giant, smelly lady come through here?
[Crabs clack claws]
Finn
: Uh, are you guys being weird, or is that normal crab stuff?
[Crabs clack claws]
Finn
:
[Climbs up cliff]
Stupid crabs.
[Giant parrot lands on the side of the cliff, eats the crabs, flies away and lays an egg]
[It snows at the top of the cliff]
Finn
:
[Climbs to the top and walks towards cabins in the snow]
Jake?! Susan?!
Finn
:
[Enters cabin]
Hello?
[Kneels and looks on the floor]
Burlap sacks. Seed packets.
[Wifts away seed packets and finds a dusty book]
Oh.
[Picks up the book and blows away the dust. The book is titled "Awesome Gourds: Theory & Practice"]
[Scene transitions to the outside]
Finn
:
[Exits cabin clothed in burlap sacks and seed packets]
Now I can look like an idiot while I freeze to death.
[The snow stops falling, the wind stops blowing and the weather gets warm]
Finn
:
[Sweats]
Woof.
[Snow melts]
Finn
: Actually, these sacks are really working a treat. I'm sweating like an everyday Susan in here.
[Looks around]
Oh, I see. That works, too.
[Shakes off seed packets before spotting something in the distance]
What the...?
[Walks away to cold weather pillars while taking off burlap sacks. Kneels next to a cube of snow, picks up a clump of snow and it melts in his hand]
Neat. It's like the border to the Ice Kingdom, but not really.
[Cold wind blows aggressively]
Finn
:
[Shivers and looks behind him. The snow is falling again]
Tush! Coming down hard again.
[Walks back towards cabins]
I better head back.
[Scene transitions. The fog is too thick to see through. The sky distorts]
Finn
:
[Walks with eyes pinched and hands held up in front of him]
Shack? Shack? Sack? Shack!
[Trips and falls]
Ow! Oof!
[Rolls down snowy hill and rolls into a snowball]
Oh! Oh! Aah! Ohh!
Finn
:
[Crashes on grass and snowball breaks]
Ohh.
[Touches head. Looks around and walks towards the forest]
[Scene transitions to inside the forest]
[Animal squeaks]
Finn
:
[Spots animal trapped in a cage]
Ruh‐roh. Looks like someone's still living here.
[Climbs down and walks up to the cage. Chuckles]
Look at you. You're thick as heck. You're thicker than a normal Susan.
[Gets caught in a trap and flies up]
Whoa!
[Stuck in a net]
Good grief, man! Were you in on this?! That's shady. Do your parents know what you do all day? I mean, honestly.
[Twig breaks and heavy footsteps approach. A
bear
comes]
Finn
: Giant bear? Come on! I fought
the Lich
at the
edge of space‐time
, man. You're out of your depth. You best just roll on, brah.
Bear
:
[Sniffs and licks Finn]
Finn
: Hey!
Bear:
[Growls and opens mouth wide]
Finn
: Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[Kicks bear in the nose and slings himself to a higher branch]
Bear
:
[Tries to eat Finn again]
Finn
:
[Breaks off branch and hits the bear in the nose]
Bear
:
[Cowers on the ground, holds his nose and groans in pain]
Finn
: See?! I told you!
Alva
: Stopp! Nej, nej, nej! (Stop! No, no, no!)
Alva
: Ledsen, Albert. Det där är inte mat. (Sorry, Albert. That is not food) Bzzt!
[Pinches cheeks]
[Buzzer sounds and the net falls to the ground]
Finn
: Oof!
Alva
:
[Approaches Finn]
Huff! Det var mig en märklig en. Har inte träffat nån som honom på länge. Det är nog bäst att vi tar reda på vad han gör här. Kom, Albert. (Phew! That sure is a weird one. Haven't met anyone like him in a long time. It's probably best that we figure out what he's doing here. Come, Albert.)
[Alva walks away. Albert follows and drags Finn with him]
[Scene transitions to a small river where a turtle sits]
Alva
:
[Walks up to the river]
Hmm.
[Picks up the turtle and places it upright in the sand. She digs in the sand with her hands, picks up three turtle eggs and sits by her stove]
Finn
: Hey! You're a human, right? Do you know where my friends are? A dog, a robot, and another human who smells — and I've been saying this a lot — not great.
[Alva pricks a hole in an egg with her nail and places it in the pan. It whistles]
Finn
: Does this mean I made it to the human place? Did you send for me?
[Alva pricks the rest of the eggs and places them in the pan]
Finn
: Are you the mayor of here or like the tribe leader? I‐I mean... Agh. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying.
[Alva walks up to Finn and looks at him]
Finn
: Hi.
Alva
:
[Squishes Finn's cheeks]
Hmm.
[Nods before pinching her own cheeks]
Bzzt.
[Buzzer sounds and Finn falls to the ground, landing on his face]
[Alva walks away to the cooking eggs and sits on the stool]
Finn
:
[Crawls out of the net]
Thanks. Can I have my backpack back... pack?
Alva
:
[Picks up Finn's saber and points angrily]
Huh?!
[Waves the saber and growl. She clicks her tongue and tries to break it with knee before throwing it away in his direction]
[Saber sticks in the ground]
Finn
: Lady!
[Alva fumbles through his backpack and throws an orange and a sketchbook which lands by his feet]
Finn
:
[Growls and picks up sketchbook]
Lady, you can't just...
Alva
:
[Takes out
Finn's flute
]
Hmm...
[Throws the flute to Albert]
Finn
:
[Angrily]
Doh!
Albert
:
[Yawns and smacks lips. Picks up the flute and sticks it in his nostril]
Finn
: No.
[Albert scratches his butt with the flute]
Finn
: No!
[Albert sticks it in his nostril again]
Finn
: No.
[Albert scratches his butt again]
Finn
:
[Slumps]
No. One last time, have you seen my brother anywhere? He looks like this.
[Drags down cheeks to imitate Jake's jowels]
[Alva shrugs]
Finn
:
[Picks up the sketchbook and shows Alva a pencil drawing of Jake]
This guy. His name is Jake.
Alva
:
[Throws her arms in the air]
En hund! (A dog!)
[Shakes head no]
Finn
:
[Closes sketchbook]
Oh.
[Alva walks up to Finn, sits in front of him and taps the sketchbook]
Finn
: What?
[Alva taps it again and makes a face]
Finn
: You want me to draw you?
[Picks up pencil]
[Alva nods]
Finn
: Oh. I didn't draw that picture of Jake. I don't know how to draw, really.
Banana Guard 16
tried to teach me once, but it didn't stick.
[Alva makes the face again]
Finn
:
[Chuckles]
Okay.
[Scribbles]
Okay.
[Shows amateur drawing]
Alva
:
[Sighs in disappointment, takes the sketchbook and closes it]
Jag trodde det skulle se bättre ut. (I thought it would look better.)
[Gives sketchbook back and taps it]
[Thunder crashes and a tornado approaches. Alva flinches. Albert sucks the flute into his nose completely]
Alva
:
[Alva goes to the stove, picks up the hot eggs in her hands and throws them up and down]
Ooh! Ooh‐ooh. Ooh. Ooh!
[Stuffs eggs in mouth]
Hett, hett, hett, hett, hett! Hett! Hett, hett, hett! (Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot!)
[Runs into her house which is giant tree stump]
[Albert climbs to the top of stump]
Finn
:
[Stand up]
What, a‐are you folks afraid of thunder?
[It starts hailing. The tornado approaches]
Finn
:
[Screams and runs into house]
Lady! I know a lot about living in trees, and this thing's not going to... hold.
[Looks up and sees that the house is full of advanced technology]
[Albert climbs in while the hail falls in through the hole at the top.
Alva presses a button on the wall and a blue force field covers the top, shielding the house from the weather. Albert sits on a red piece of cloth hanging from the celing and swings on it]
Finn
: This place is teched out.
[Looks around]
I should have known, I guess, since you talked to that net earlier.
[Alva climbs down a hatch in the floor]
Finn
:
[Looks down the hatch]
You can't understand me, can you?
[Jumps down]
[Scene transitions to the large basement which is filled with old cabinets and computers]
Finn
:
[Climbs over junk]
Something's been bubbling up inside me. I really want to say it out loud, but I've been embarrassed. Okay. Are crabs robots?
[Approaches Alva]
In what way isn't a crab a robot? I guess I understand that BMO's not a crab, but I don't understand why BMO's not a crab.
[A film projector is on and whirrs loudly]
Alva
: Shh!
[Waves at him to come]
Finn
:
[Sits next to Alva]
Lady, where did everyone go to?
Alva
: Shh!
[Leans on Finn's shoulder]
[They watch the film. A human man named
Greg
appears and waves. Two more humans named
Wing
and
Sue
come out of a house.
Hans
waves and
Becca
is hugging him.
Kulap
and
Michel
experiment with controlling snowing to build a fort. Alva sits in front of a computer, looks into the camera and reaches for it before getting back to work]
Finn
: Hey, that's you! Your name's Alva. Hi, Alva.
[
Greta
and
Aadil
experiment with controlling rain to water a farm]
Text

Skarapport: Film Nummer Ett 3/1 (Damage Report: Film Number One 3/1) [Presumably January 3rd or March 1st, but the former is more likely due to the day-month-year system being standard in Swedish]
[
King
and
Tai
look at a cactus. Their names get scribbled out. Tai approaches the camera.
William
, who's name is scribbled out, watches six tornadoes.]
Finn
: Oh.
[
Lynda
, who's name is also scribbled out, is held in the beak of a giant parrot. The parrot drops her and screams. The camera pans to
Hiram
fleeing from a giant wolf who then chases the camera]

ÄNDEN FILM Ø7ØØ15 (THE END FILM) [The numbers are presumably also a date. "Änden film" is grammatically incorrect and not the words used to mark the end of a film. The correct term is "slut" (end), but this was most likely changed due to it being a rude word in English]
Finn
: So that's it? That's humans?!
[Projector turns off]
Finn
: We came all this way.
[Slumps and sighs]
[Alva puts her arm around Finn's head]
Finn
: It's just you and me, Alva. And Susan, I guess, if she's okay. I don't know.
[Alva wipes her face with her sleeve]
[Howling stops]
Alva
: Huh?
[Puts hand behind her ear. She pokes Finn]
Finn
:
[Straightens his back]
Hmm?
[Alva points up]
Finn
: Sounds like the storm stopped.
Alva
:
[Alva fumbles through the junk an picks up a pair of binoculars]
Hunden! (The dog!)
[Scene transitions to the surface. Finn and Alva ride on Albert's back]
Finn
:
[Looks through binoculars]
Hmm. No sign of him.
[Jake screams]
Finn
: Jake!
Alva
: Hyah!
[Albert runs, hops down the cliff and crashes in the sand]
[Jake is fighting a giant green crab]
[Albert runs toward him]
Finn
: Jake! Hey, Jake!
Jake
: Oh, hey, buddy. Man, am I glad to see you. Hold on a second.
[Makes his foot large and kicks the crab into the ocean]
Man, this place sucks! I got attacked by 19 giant crabs in just the last 30 seconds.
Finn
: Yeah, man. I almost got eaten by this...
Jake
:
[Interrupts]
Hey, that's awesome. Now let's get the heck outta here.
[Points at Alva]
Are they coming, too? I'm not sharing my rations.
Finn
: What? No, this is Alva. I‐I think she's human. Alva? Alva, have you seen my friends?
[Draws in the sketchbook]
BMO and Susan?
[Shows Alva amateur drawings of BMO and Susan]
[Alva grabs the sketchbook and shakes her head no]
Jake
: Oh, stuff, man. That's the slow shake. That's the universal death gesture!
Alva
: Nej, nej! Inte död! (No, no! Not dead!)
[Draws her island]
Vi är här... (We are here...)
[Circles her hand in the air]
Mitt land... (My country...)
[Draws nearby islands]
Andra länder. (Other countries.)
Finn
: Oh, shoot, man. More islands. BMO and Susan must've washed all up on one of all up of them.
Jake
: Well, it looks like there's only three more. This shouldn't be too hard. Right?
[Scene transitions to BMO inside the
Better Reality
virtual reality game. He's relaxing in a beach chair and a waiter called
WAITMAN79
offers him a Finn cake]
Waiter
: Sir BMO? Another Finn cake, sir?
BMO
: Oui.
[Takes the Finn cake and drops it on the ground where he's already dropped a few]
BMO
:
[Lays down]
Ah, this if the life. I wish you guys could be here, too... on the moon.
[BMO is shown to be on the moon and looking at the earth]
And Susan, too, I guess. She seems...fine.
