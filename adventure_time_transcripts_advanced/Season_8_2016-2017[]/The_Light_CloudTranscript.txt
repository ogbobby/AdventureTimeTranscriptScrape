Finn:I'm leaving the island.
I'm leaving my mom.
What a wild adventure, yellow stretching dog.
You said it, beautiful baby boy.
[ Rumbling ]Huh? Huh?
The guardian!
Oh, no!
We never should've left the island!
Now we die!
Minerva: See? You die.
By my calculations, you stand a 0.00001% chance
of making it past the guardian.
Can't you just turn him off?
He's here for our protection.
If we were tough enough to make it past him,
we wouldn't need him!
But...
But none of that matters,
because you can stay safe right here with me!
Minerva bot, hug my son again.
Mom, listen, I'm so happy I finally got to meet you
But I have to get back to my life eventually.
Did you see the simulation? You'd die!
Let's watch it again.
[ Tape rewinding ]
♪♪
[ Indistinct conversations, laughter ]
[ Bells jingle ]
Be right with you.
Excuse me. Where's the soup?
Ugh.
I told you yesterday ‐‐We are a toy store.
We don't sell sou‐‐Wooh?
Hi, Frieda.
Kara.What are you doing here?
Hope you didn't cometo get the soup!
I, um, I wanted to apologizefor everything.
You knew there was more to lifethan just the islands,
and I ‐‐I didn't believe you.
I know you can't ever forgive me,
but I am truly sorry.
Don't sweat it.
Awkward feelings averted.
Let's have some soup!
And who's this little electronic cutie?
What happened to you?
I grew up, and I learned to accept the Founders' truth.
Frieda.
The outside world's really cool.
I have cool friends.
Yeah!
I live in a cool tree house.
Yeah!
I go on cool quests.Yeah!
That sounds dangerous!
No!
But people need danger in order to grow.
How will y'all survive when you leave the island?
Leaving the island would destroy us.
Besides, why would they want to leave?
We have everything you could need.
You hungry?
[ Snaps fingers ]Always.
Minerva bot, please show him today’s specials.
Minerva bot: Happy home burgers with choco fries
and our famous cozy banana split blankie.
Gimme all them specials in one bowl.
[ Munching loudly ]
Jake!
I'm so glad you like it.
[ Munching continues ]
If you're not gonna hear what I'm saying,
then look inside my head!
Danger zone!
[ Zap ]
♪♪
Finn!
I'm okay.
Sweet remembrances, bro.
Your world seems so chaotic.
Your ruler's a piece of gum, your friend's a vampire,
you dated a bit of fire.
Your life is constantly in danger!
It's my home. It's where I belong.
As your mother, I think you belong somewhere safe.
It's not your responsibility to fight monsters all the time.
Let the grass kid do it ‐‐or the vampire girl.
Minerva bot 5, ready the cloud chamber.
Now, be a good boy and get into this machine
so it can juice up your precious essence.
[ Gasps ]
Pftttt!
[ Munching ]
[ Sighs ]
Mom, not only am I not getting juiced,
I'm gonna leave this place and take everyone to freedom!
Okay, sweetie, but I think you'll find
everyone's pretty happy here.
It's true. I'm really, really happy here.
Don't you rememberyour dreams of exploration?
If I remember, I might get...angry.
You should be angry ‐‐at me.
Nah. I'm over it.
[ Indistinct conversations ]Finn: Hey, everyone!
Uh, excuse me.
[ High‐pitched scream ]
[ Conversations stop ]
I know y'all like living on this tiny island
'cause it's safe and chill,
but you don't have to live like this.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Wait!
You thinkthe outside world is scary?
Well, you know what’s really scary?
Bees!
Germs!
Frogs!
Crowds!
Ngyuhhh!
No.
Letting fear make all your decisions for you.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
You! Do you know you have free will?
Is ‐‐ Is thatwhat you're selling?
You got to ‐‐How do you even ‐‐ Ugh!
Finn: How do you even know if you're happy
if someone else decidedfor you?
Follow me!
Don't you want to be able to choose what you do?
And where you go?
Crowd: Sounds hard.
Yeah, but it's also fun.
And boring. And good and bad.
Life's never just one thing.
Yeah.
We got freedom smushed up inside our guts.
We want to explore and have experiences
and learn new things.
Kingdoms made of candy, beautiful dragons,
fire‐breathing princesses, incredibly sad wizards ‐‐
It's all waiting for you across the ocean.
So misguided.
Hey, this guy is great!
What are we hanging around here for?
[ Crowd murmuring ]What?!
I did want to leave the island when I was younger, but ‐‐
You can leave now. Just come with me.
[ Crowd cheering ]They're actually listening to him.
All aboard!
[ Cheering continues ]
[ Feedback ]Patch me into all Minerva bots.
Attention!
For your protection, the entire population of the islands
will now be uploaded.
Once the field has reached peak saturation,
Doom! Rrrr! Vroom!the brain maps of every citizen will be simultaneously
and preserved in the island chain brain frame.
Say good bye to your meat bodies!
[ Crowd whimpering ]
Mom!
[ Whimpering continues ]
Stop!
Hey! There's my boy!
Your cloud is freaking us all out!
Sweetie, you forced my hand.
This is the only wayI can protect you.
You're only doing this because I said I wouldn't stay.
So I'll stay.
Just promise to stop messing with people.
I'm helping people.
I know about helping people.
[ Zap ]
♪♪
Finn, you ‐‐ you grew upto be a helper, too?
If your world taught you to behave like that,
maybe it's not all bad.
[ All screaming ]
Vroom! Vroom![ Imitates tires screeching ]
Perhaps I acted rashly.
I just didn't want to lose you again.
But I'll do everything I can to help you leave this island.
I don't have to leave...right away.
I mean...you're my mom.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Ahoy!
Now boarding the historic voyage of the humans
back to the land of Ooo!
Oh, you mean right now?
I thought you meant, like, in a while.
I've still got some things to finish up.
We should definitely keep in touch, though.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
You can't teach a fish to dance overnight, son.
Well, as long as they got the option.
Ready, Frieda?
Ready.
[ Boat horn blows ]
Finn:I'm leaving the island.
I'm leaving my mom.
What a wild adventure, yellow stretching dog.
You said it, beautiful baby boy.
[ Rumbling ]Huh? Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Frieda: Psych!
Ha ha! That's right!
You got fooled by Frieda!
Hey, buddy.
Aaah!
Yaaaaaah...
Aaaaaah...
...aaaaaah!
Huh?
Patching her in now.
Guardian, you have done just a terrific job,
but it's time to stand down.
[ Boat horn blows ]
When do I fire the torpedoes?
Kara, you ready to go?
Actually, I think we're headed in a different direction.
Time for new memories.
So, where are we going, Kara?
I've been thinking ‐‐
I kind of like "Susan" better.
Okay, Susan.
Hmm. Homey.
It was.
Take care of yourself in Ooo.
Be careful when you're eating blueberries.
Too many can hurt your tummy.
Your ship is moving out of range.
Is this...really you?
Once you uploaded your brain and stuff, like,
are you still the same person?
I don't know for sure, but I feel like it's me.
I hope that's enough.
Goodbye.
