I don't know how to dealwith my daughter, Bronwyn.
I havea granddaughter? Psych, I knew that. What's the problem, mijo.
Bronwyn is not doing wellat school. She seems to be busy enoughwith homework when she's here, but her grades are slipping. And her teacher says she keepsfalling asleep at her desk.
Why is she so unengaged?
And how can I manageher towards financial success if she's that unengaged?
I thought you might havesome insight because of your teenagekind of lifestyle.
What say we rifle through herbiz next time she's out?
Well, I'm no snoop,
but I found these unusualgraphics in her recycling bin.
What do you make of these?
Oh.
Mm‐hmm.
Ahh.
What are you thinking?
Not sure yet. I'll have to sleep on it.
I'll let you know tomorrowif I think of anything.
Weird.

Nope.That's my granddad. What?You here to bust me?
Nah,I'm just here to skate.
Yeah, okay.
Show me some moves.
Noice!
‐Yeah.‐Pretty good moves.
You're actually kinda cool,for a gwampa.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.I value your opinion.
[ Laughs ]That's a spot‐on KKW.
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
Um, that reminds me.
We're supposed to talk aboutgetting your grades up
in school or something.What?
We're worried about your,um,
financial success!
I knew it.
You're not cool!
You're just like Dad!‐What?
I mean, hey, I love your dad,but we're nothing alike.
It looks like this round grampsis a real square.
[ Laughter ]
I'm not a square.
But now I am.

What?They like me.
They like my ageless styleand everything.

Y‐you're the fart.
What? No.
Old fart.
I'm cool!
Son, it's worsethan we thought.
Oh, Koo.Is it black magic?
A cursed ring?An investment scam?
Worse!
I tried real‐talkingwith Bronwyn last night,
and now she thinksI'm a square!
I feel like you're losing sightof the point here, Dad.
Pretty much everyonethinks I'm great, right?
Maybe stay awayfrom my daughter.
Don't worry, Son.
I won't rest until Bronwynrealizes how cool I am!
But what about...

Are you two ready to thrash?
From here, you must skatethe entire length of the park.
First, grind down the ramp,
through the bar maze,
past the big‐armed worm,
through the junkyard,
over the log swamp,
and finally cross the finishat the bottomless pit of love.
