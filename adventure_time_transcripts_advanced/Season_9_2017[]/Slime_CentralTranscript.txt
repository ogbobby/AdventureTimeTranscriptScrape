Okay, we'll find the crown,grab the jewel,
and then give a couple tugs on the skyhooks!
Got it!
Here's some trail mix for the road!
You think Betty and Simon hanging out is a good thing?
Totally.
They're two wackadoo peas in a wackadoodle pod.
Something about it makes me feel weird in the ethics.
Well, you don't want to stareat happiness too hard, you know?
Why?
'Cause it stares back, man.
Slime Town is mad nasty.
Let's blend in.
Yeesh.
This smells like the locker room of a gym for dead fish.
Eh, you get used to it,though.
That's the great thing about smells.
Man, where is everyone?
[ Bass thumping ]
Skate size?
Uh, 10.
Universal.
Aw, man!
Okay, you look dope.
[ Music blares ]
[ Gasps ]
Whoa.
Slime Princess got big.

Her slime's tougher than it looks.
LSP: Finn, Jake!
Over here!
LSP!
I'm not LSP anymore.I'm LSP.
Oh, 'cause you're Lumpy Slime Princess.
Bingo!
You guys on a team yet?
Why do we need teams?
No, you can't be on my team.
Me and Spurtle Princessare gonna win it all.
Right, girls?
What are ‐‐What are you...?
[ Crowd chanting "Snack pack!" ]
Oh, Glob!
[ Chanting continues ]

Blechfast Princess,Bileberry Princess,
and Hot Blob Princess are about to skate.

quack grinds,sheering the duck,
or insincere hot‐dogging
will result in instant disqualification!

Hot Blob Princess
: Night!
Bileberry Princess
: Snack!
Ah.
[ Cheers and applause ]
And the winner is...
Wawa!
Snack Pack!
As always, the prize is absorption
into the body of our bumpin' leader.
[ Crowd chanting"Skate to assimilate!" ]
[ Laughter ]
Isn't assimilation amazing?
No! It's horrifying.
It might be comfy,
like a hug that turns you into a hug.
What happens to the losers?
They go in the losers' cage,
and they're stripped of their skating rights!
Oh.
New plan!
‐We enter the contest...‐Yeah.
‐...win...‐Of course.
...then I grab the jewel
and you stretch us on out of that bod.
Won't we get absorbed,though?
We'll just believe in ourselves way too much.
She can't absorb us if we're self‐absorbed.
Okay, but you needa three‐person team to compete,
and I'm taken!
What?
Splurtle Princess
: We had a vote and you're out.
LSP
: But I'm the plucky underdog!
Splurtle Princess
: No, you're just terrible.
Abracajamiel can do the splits.
Whoo!
Whatever!
Nyah!
Attention,super cool party people!
My new, totally awesome team,The Lumps,
challenges my old team,The Stupids,
to a skate battle.
[ Cheers and applause ]
First up...
The Lumps.

No, wait. Discontinue the beat.
[ Music stops ]
What are you doing, man?
This!

Ah!

I know! It's better.
[ Groans ]
Okay, we can still save this, Finn.

[ Crowd murmuring, whistling ]
Hyah!

[ Groaning ]
Wa‐waa!
The Stupids win by default!
Whoo!
Ahh.
No! I can still do this!I know I can.
Ah, well.
This isn't howit's supposed to happen.
We blew it.
Eh, it'll work outsomehow.
The winnerswill now be rewarded
with glorious absorption!
[ Crowd chanting"Skate to assimilate!" ]
[ Laughter ]
Today's loserswill now be punished.
P‐P‐P‐Punished!
With shameful absorption!
Take them 'round back.
[ Wheel squeaking ]
Hey, this is gonnawork out somehow.
I've got the loser sticks!
Poke the losers.
Whoo.[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, whoo.
Yes!
Take me,Slime Princess!
Huh!Hold onto me.
This placereally is supes comfy.
[ Grunting ]
Yoink.
Oh, I'm starting to turn.
Pull us out, Jake.
In a minute.
What?!
It's like being in a warm bathfull of snot.
Aah! We're trapped!
It'll work out somehow.
[ Gasps ] Jake, no!Fight the slime!
I'm havingthe slime of my life.
[ Chuckles ]
Jake.
I may as wellgive in to it.
Maybe Simonwill save Ooo.
This isn't an upliftingunderdog ending.
You're still here?
I'm not assimilating.
And no one can see my cool outfit
through all this lumpin's slime.
[ Groans ]
Looks like LSP is too much of a killjoy for our Slime Queen!
She's gonna be rejected!
Aah!
[ Both groan ]
Em‐Em‐Em‐Embarrassing!
Y'all are bounced.
Jerks.
I got the jewel, but I lost Jake.
[ Warbles ]
You're not a Slime person?
No, I totally faked it.
I just saw this lumpalicious party,
and I was like,"These are my people!"
But even though I shoplifted this super‐cool outfit,
I still didn't fit in.
I guess I don't fit in...anywhere!
[ Crying ]
Jake could fit in anywhere.
Whatever happened,he was always like,
"It'll work out."
Stop being so selfish, Finn!I'm the one hurting here!
You don't even know what it's like to be an underdog.
You and Jake always win ‐‐always!
You're right, LSP.We do.
Don't worry, Jake!I vow to get you back in shape.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, my Glob,this is it!
The crowd‐pleasing climax
where the beautiful underdoggets the hunk.
Rom‐com style!
