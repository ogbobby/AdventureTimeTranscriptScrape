Ice King: What else we got here? A penguin. Oh. Right. [ Gasps ] Something! Is that... Oh...my...glaah!
Ice King: [ Gasps ]  You a toucan?
Betty: Simon, I've been trying so hard to help you. I've tried reprogramming‐‐nnnyour ‐‐ your crown, Code‐mapping, penguin‐napping, co‐mingling with magic, and grasping and grappling, but it just hasn't been happening. It's saddening, it's maddening, and I'm rapping and ‐‐ and...

Ice King: Hey! So good to see you! You still working at that same place?
Betty: Mm, my work takes me all over.

Ice King: That's clever.
Betty: Hello, Simon.
Ice King: Uh, flowers.
Betty: Come in. Come in.
Ice King: I really like how you decorated the place. I'm really into skulls and old teeth in jars, too.
Betty: Ready for our date?
Ice King: You bet.
Betty: Bah‐bam! Aaaaah! [ Pants ] This a‐way.
Ice King: What is this place?
Betty: In the old days, we would meet here, and you would give me books because you had a subscription to the Book a Day Club.
Ice King: Book a Day?
Betty: You gave me the excess books because I was associated with Books for the Bookless.
Waiter/Bogo: [ Laughs ] Simon! You want your usual booth?
Betty: Bogo! You remember him? Lead the way, Bogo!

Betty: Yes?
Ice King: Are we going splitsies?

Betty: I've tried everything I canthink of to make Simon remember. Is there something I'm missing? What am I doing wrong?
Tiny Manticore: Maybe you're going after someone who doesn't exist anymore. Why not take him as he is?
Betty: You're making a lot of sense,Tiny Manticore. We're like two shadows, two ghosts caught in limbo.
Tiny Manticore: It sounds depressing when you say it that way. Think of a different way to say it.
Ice King: [ Crying softly ] [ Sighs heavily ]
Gunter: Wenk.
Ice King: Oh, uh, just stretching.
Gunter: Wenk?
Ice King: The date? Uh, yeah, it went great. I don't know about a second date, though. I don't wanna be that guy who just hangs out with his girlfriend all the time and doesn't see his friends.
Ice King: Man, I wanna be that guy so bad.
[ Whoosh ]
Ice King: Hey, I was just talking about you to my penguin. Have you met Gunter?
Betty: Yes. I kidnapped him that one time. Look, Simon ‐‐I mean, Ice King.

Patience St. Pim: Uh...well, when you weren't looking, her ‐‐ her mom showed up and told her that her old boyfriend wanted to be with her again, and they ran off together. The end.
Ice King: Her mom?
Patience St. Pim: Well, I gotta go.
Patience St. Pim: I almost forgot! Surprise!
